By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Calculate growth rates. Understand the role of compounding effects in modern growth trends and beyond. Construct and interpret plots of logarithms and plots with logarithm (ratio) scales. Perform all these operations in Excel. We will use data from the Maddison Project Database 2023 (Bolt, Jutta and van Zanden, Jan Luiten 2024) and the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and P.Timmer 2015), allowing us to compare real economic outcomes over time and across countries. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in this chapter will always refer to real GDP. 1.1 Introduction Figure 1.1: Long-run trends in GDP per capita: 1700-2022 Figure 1.1 represents the evolution of GDP per capita over more than three centuries in today’s largest economies, where we measure the size of an economy by their total GDP. This data tells us of a story of growing global wealth (or standards of living) and inequality: Modern growth is a relatively recent phenomenon: GDP per capita was relatively constant in all countries until the late 18th century. It then started to increase exponentially in all countries at some point over the last 200 years. In most countries, this led to GDP per capita being multiplied by a factor of 10 or more. The great divergence: this exponential growth pattern started at different times in different countries. As a result, the difference between the richest and the poorest countries in this sample has grown from a factor of 4 to 5 in 1800 to a factor of 10 to 11 in 2018. There is also nothing to suggest that the countries lagging behind will eventually catch up to the most advanced economies. A variety of experiences: in most countries, the path has not been entirely smooth. The Russian Federation, Japan or South Africa experienced decades of stagnation or decline in the last 50 years. Similarly, some of the poorest countries, not represented here, have seen little to no growth as well as periods of prolonged decline over the same period. Growth rates and the dynamic performance of economies The dynamics of GDP over the long term observed in Figure 1.1 are the result of growth processes that are cumulative over time. Each year, an economy has the potential to build on the previous level of production to generate more output, which would allow for further increases in output in the following year, etc… In this view, the growth rate of output from one year to the next is a useful indicator of the dynamic performance of an economy. Irrespective of the size of the economy, it can also be used to compare the economic performance of different countries over the same period or the performance of a single economy over different periods. Economic theories of growth seek to understand the mechanisms that drive these changes in output and growth over time and the reasons why they may differ across countries. The power of compounding effects Two comparisons shed some light on the relationships between growth rates and changes in the levels of GDP in the long-run. Why do Americans have bigger fridges and cars than Britons? Between 1885 and 2022, GDP per capita in the United Kingdom increased from $6,132 to $38,407. Standards of living have therefore been multiplied by more than 6 in this country over this period. In contrast, GDP per capita in the United States over the same period has increased from $6,424 to $58,487, a nine-fold increase in standards of living. Starting from a similar level as that of the United Kingdom, GDP per capita in the United States has therefore grown at a faster rate and is now about 50% higher. How much higher than that of the United Kingdom must have been the annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States to arrive at this outcome? Why has GDP per capita in Nigeria not converge to that of the United Kingdom? GDP per capita in Nigeria has increased from $810 to $5,070 between 1885 and 2022. Therefore in both the United Kingdom and Nigeria, standards of living have been multiplied by slightly more than 6 over this period. As we will see, this means that they have grown at the same average annual growth rate. As a result, the two countries have not diverged but they have not converged either; the United Kingdom was and remains a bit more than 7.5 times richer than Nigeria. For GDP per capita in Nigeria to have converged to that of the United Kingdom over this period, how much higher should its annual growth rate have been on average? The answer to both questions is probably less than you would expect. Compounding effects explain why small differences in annual growth rates of GDP can have significant impacts on the levels of GDP in the long-run. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to reformulate these problems in mathematical terms and solve for the precise answer. You will also be equipped to produce informative graphical representations of growth trajectories (using logarithms) and use these techniques to extract some relevant facts about growth in countries across the world and over time. 1.2 Growth rates Most economic variables are observed at discrete time intervals. For example, to produce the plot in Figure 1.1, we used annual observations of GDP per capita (see Table 1.1). GDP is only observed at separate points in time. Time is discrete in the sense that it only takes on integer values, for example \\(t=2000, 2001, ..., 2004\\). 1.2.1 Definition The growth rate of \\(y\\) is the percentage change in \\(y\\) between time \\(t-1\\) and time \\(t\\): \\[g_t = \\frac{\\Delta y}{y} = \\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}-1\\] where \\(\\Delta y_t=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y}=y_t-y_{t-1}\\) is the change in variable \\(y\\) between \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\). In percentage terms: \\[\\%g_t=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \\times 100 \\] In Economics, growth rates are usually expressed in annual terms unless specified otherwise. Using the data in Table 1.1, the growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States between 2000 and 2001 is equal to: \\[\\% GDP_{2001}=\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2001}}{GDP_{2000}}-1\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{45878}{45886}-1\\right) \\times 100 = -0.01743\\%\\] Note that a growth rate can be negative. In this case, it simply means that the average value of goods and services produced per person in the United States declined between 2000 and 2001. Column 3 of Table 1.1 shows the annual growth rate of US GDP per capita over the full sample period (rounded to 2 decimal points). Table 1.1: The annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the US Year (t) GDP per capita (in $2011) Growth rate (%) 2000 45886 NA 2001 45878 -0.02 2002 46266 0.85 2003 47158 1.93 2004 48493 2.83 2005 49655 2.40 2006 50490 1.68 2007 50902 0.82 2008 50276 -1.23 2009 48453 -3.63 2010 49267 1.68 2011 49675 0.83 2012 50436 1.53 2013 51011 1.14 2014 51797 1.54 2015 52808 1.95 2016 53301 0.93 2017 54152 1.60 2018 55455 2.41 2019 56469 1.83 2020 54379 -3.70 2021 57523 5.78 2022 58487 1.68 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023. 1.2.2 Growth rates and logarithms An alternative formula using logarithms provides a useful approximation to the growth rate. Unless otherwise state, “logarithm” will refer to the “natural logarithm” in the chapter. Using the definition of the growth rate of variable \\(y\\), we have: \\[g_t = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}-1 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad 1+g_t = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}\\] Taking the logarithm on both sides and using the following property of logarithms \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}}= \\ln{a}-\\ln{b}\\): \\[\\ln{(1+g_t)} = \\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{t-1}} \\] For small values of \\(g_t\\), the approximation \\(\\ln{(1+g_t)} \\approx g_t\\) holds, leading to: The growth rate of variable \\(y\\) is well approximated by the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\) (for small \\(g\\)): \\[ g_t \\approx \\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\] where \\(\\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\) is the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\). Expressed in percentage terms: \\[ \\%g_t \\approx \\Delta\\ln{y_t} \\times 100\\] The equality would hold exactly if \\(y\\) were a continuous variable (see Appendix). Going back to the numerical example in the previous section: \\[\\% GDP_{2001} = (\\ln{GDP_{2001}} - \\ln{GDP_{2000}}) \\times 100 = (\\ln{45878} - \\ln{45886}) \\times 100 = -0.01744\\%\\] which is very close to the value calculated in the previous section. 1.3 Average growth rates The annual growth rates reported in Table 1.1 are mostly positive, suggesting that on average the economy grew on a consistent basis over the period observed. Can we summarise this growth experience over the long-run in a single number? 1.3.1 The trend growth path Figure 1.2 represents actual GDP per capita in the United States between 1870 and 2018 (black solid line) and an estimate of the trend in GDP per capita over the same period (dashed red line). Actual GDP per capita fluctuates around the trend line but both appear to be growing on average at the same rate over time. This average growth rate provides a clearer summary of long-run trends than the annual growth rates presented in Table 1.1. It abstracts from short-run fluctuations, which can be very large as in the case of the Great Depression in the 1930s, while still capturing the trajectory of GDP per capita in the long-run. Figure 1.2: GDP per capita in the United States: 1870-2023 How can we obtain an estimate of the annual growth rate of GDP per capita along this trend growth path? There are several valid methods to do so but there is at least one very incorrect one, which we discuss now. We might be tempted to calculate the average annual growth rate as the percentage change in GDP per capita between 1870 ($4,803) and 2018 ($55,335) divided by the number of years in between (148): \\[\\bar{g} =\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} -1 \\right)\\frac{1}{148}\\times 100= \\left(\\frac{55,335}{4,803}-1 \\right)\\frac{1}{148}\\times 100 = 7.11\\%\\] However, that would be wrong. Starting at $4,803 and assuming GDP per capita grows at an annual growth rate of 7.11% would lead to a level of GDP per capita 148 years later equal to $124,840,484, more than 2000 times the actual value of GDP per capita in 2018! 1.3.2 The compound growth rate The compound annual growth rate provides an estimate of the average growth rate which avoids falling into the same trap. Intuitively, it is the constant growth rate such that if GDP per capita had grown at this same rate every year, then starting at $4,803 in 1870, GDP per capita 148 years later would be exactly equal to $55,335. Assume that GDP per capita grows at the same rate \\(\\bar{g}\\) every year. Using the growth rate formula, \\(\\bar{g} = \\frac{GDP_{1871}}{GDP_{1870}}-1\\): \\[GDP_{1871}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}\\] and \\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1871}\\] Substituting the first expression into the second gives: \\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\\bar{g})^{2}GDP_{1870}\\] and \\[GDP_{1873}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\\bar{g})^{3}GDP_{1870}\\] By repeated substitution: \\[GDP_{2018}=(1+\\bar{g})^{148}GDP_{1870}\\] Definition: Compound growth Growth derived from growth achieved in previous periods. Intuition: each year, the growth rate applies to the initial level of GDP as well as to the accumulated growth from previous years. In other words, each year’s growth generates further growth in subsequent years. Such compounding effects explain how an economy growing at a relatively small annual rate may nevertheless experience the exponential increase observed in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. Solving for \\(\\bar{g}\\): \\[(1+\\bar{g})^{148}=\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad 1+\\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}\\] \\[\\bar{g}=\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}-1 =\\left(\\frac{55,335}{4,803} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}-1=0.01665 \\] or \\(\\bar{g} = 1.67\\%\\). The reason why the incorrect method discussed above led to an incorrect estimate of the average growth rate is because it ignored the presence of these compounding effects, leading it to overestimate the trend annual growth rate. Definition: Compound growth rate Let \\(y\\) be any trending variable (GDP, population, …) following an exponential pattern over time, its initial value at time \\(0\\) be \\(y_0\\) and its trend growth rate be \\(\\bar{g}\\). \\[ y_t = (1+\\bar{g})^{t} y_0 \\] Compound annual growth rate formula: \\[ \\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{y_t}{y_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \\] See Appendix 2 for derivation of results in this section. 1.3.3 The logarithm approximation As for the growth rate, there exists an approximation of this formula, which makes use of logarithms: Taking the logarithm on both sides and using the following properties of logarithms \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}}= \\ln{a}-\\ln{b}\\) and \\(\\ln{a^b} = b\\ln{a}\\): \\[\\ln{(1+\\bar{g})} = \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{0}}) \\] For small values of \\(g_t\\), the approximation \\(\\ln{(1+\\bar{g})} \\approx \\bar{g}\\) holds, leading to: \\[ \\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{0}})\\] Applying this formula to the previous example: \\[ \\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{148}(\\ln{GDP_{2018}} - \\ln{GDP_{1870}}) = \\frac{1}{148}(\\ln{55,335} - \\ln{4,803}) = 0.01651 \\] or \\(\\bar{g} = 1.65\\%\\), which close to the average growth rate calculated in the previous section, but not quite. 1.3.4 A note of caution It is easy to compute the average growth rate over any given interval of time by just plugging in values into the compound annual growth rate formula. But the compound growth rate may be misleading or uninformative as a summary statistic of long-run trends when the growth rate fluctuates widely over time. There may be decades where the growth rate is small (and even negative), followed or preceded by decades where the growth rate is high. It is important to do a preliminary inspection of the data to check that you are fitting the appropriate model to your data. For example, GDP per capita in Haiti has experienced wide swings between 1945 and 2023 as illustrated in Figure 1.3, with decades of growth (1965-1980, 1995-2015) followed by decades of decline (1955-1965, 1980-1995). The full sample period average growth rate would be relatively uninformative about this economy’s growth dynamics. Figure 1.3: GDP per capita in Haiti: 1945-2023 1.4 Logarithm plots and ratio scales Plots of GDP on a logarithmic or ratio scale feature frequently in the economic press. A few examples can be found here and here. In this section, we explain why these plots are useful representations of GDP trends and how to interpret them. 1.4.1 Logarithm plots We saw that the change in the logarithm of a variable provides a good approximation to the growth rate of this variable provided it is small enough. This suggests that growth rates can be read off the plot of the logarithm of a variable \\(y\\) against time, where the slope at any point in time is the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\) (\\(\\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\)). The left panel of Figure 1.4 plots a variable \\(y\\) which grows over time at a constant growth rate \\(g\\) according to the following function: \\(y_t = (1+g)^t y_0\\). We set \\(y_0=1\\) and \\(g=0.05\\), so \\(y\\) grows at the rate of 5% in each period starting at an initial value of 1. Figure 1.4: Plots of a variable growing at a constant rate The right panel of Figure 1.4 plots the natural logarithm of \\(y\\) allowing us to see immediately that \\(y\\) grows at a constant rate (the straight line has constant slope). This follows from the fact that the logarithm of \\(y\\) is a linear function of time: \\[y_t = (1+g)^t y_0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\ln{y_t}=\\ln{(1+g)}\\times t+\\ln{y_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\ln{y_t} \\approx g\\times t+\\ln{y_0}\\] using \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\). It is easy to verify that the slope of the logarithm plot (\\(\\Delta\\ln{y}/\\Delta t = \\Delta\\ln{y}/1\\)) is equal to 0.05, the growth rate of \\(y\\). Figure 1.5: Plots of three variables growing at a constant rate Figure 1.5 plots \\(y\\) and its logarithm for three different value of the constant growth rate \\(g\\). The exponential gap in the path of the three series illustrates the compounding effect of growth. A small difference in growth rates can generate large differences in the level of variables in the long-run. Example: GDP per capita in the United States (1870-2023) Going back to US real GDP per capita, we already noticed the exponential pattern of GDP per capita over the last two centuries. Focusing on the period 1870-2018, we can now check graphically whether the US economy grew at a relatively constant average growth rate over this period. If the growth rate is constant over time we would expect the plot of its logarithm to be well approximated by a straight line. Figure 1.6: (Level and logarithm of) GDP per capita in the United States: 1870-2023 The middle panel in Figure 1.6 represents the logarithm of US real GDP per capita. Although not perfect, the plot does appear to be approximately linear, suggesting a relatively constant growth rate over the long-run. This hypothesis can be further evaluated by fitting a line of best fit (in blue) to the plot of the logarithm (right panel) and checking how well the line fits the data. The estimate of the slope of the line of best fit is 0.0167, which corresponds to a growth rate of 1.67% per year and is similar to the compound growth rate calculated in the previous section. 1.4.2 Logarithmic (ratio) scales We have seen how the slope of the plot of the logarithm of the trending variable \\(y\\) allows us to evaluate quickly the growth rate of \\(y\\). We now turn to what it means to plot the logarithm of a variable, ie to represent a variable on a logarithmic (or ratio) scale. The left and middle panels of Figure 1.7 represent the same variable \\(y\\) growing at a rate of 5% per period and its natural logarithm \\(\\ln{y}\\) once again. The natural logarithm of \\(y\\), is the number of times Euler’s number \\(e=2.72...\\) needs to be multiplied by itself in order to obtain \\(y\\). The plots shows that when \\(y\\) is equal to 150, its natural logarithm is approximately equal to 5. So 5 is the natural logarithm of 150, or the number of times \\(e\\) needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain the number 150 (to be exact, 5 is the natural logarithm of \\(e^5=148.4132\\)). Figure 1.7: Representing variables on a logarithmic scale This gives us an alternative interpretation of the logarithm plot: every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by \\(e\\). So when at time \\(t=40\\) we read off the plot that \\(lny=2\\), this means that \\(y\\) is approximately equal to \\(e^2=7.389\\). Similarly, \\(lny=3\\) at time \\(t=60\\) means that \\(y\\) is approximately equal to \\(e^3=20.086\\). This is the intuition behind the logarithmic scale (also called log scale or ratio scale) represented on the right panel, which is constructed by relabeling the value of the natural logarithm of \\(lny\\) on the vertical axis with the corresponding value of \\(y\\). Changing the base number of the logarithm allows us to set more intuitive multiplying factors. For example, the logarithm base 2 of \\(y\\), represents the number of times the number 2 needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain \\(y\\). So on a plot of the logarithm base 2 of \\(y\\) (right panel of Figure 1.8), every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by 2. This plot can be used to read graphically on the horizontal axis how long it takes for variable \\(y\\) to double. Figure 1.8: Representing variables on a logarithmic scale (base 2) We can see that it takes slightly less than fifteen periods for \\(y\\), which is still growing at the rate of 5% per period, to double. So it would take slightly less than fifteen years for the GDP per capita of an economy that is growing at the rate of 5% per year to double. This may seem surprising but is a direct consequence of the compounding effects discussed before. Note: if the variable grows at a constant rate, the slope of the plot of of the logarithm base 2 (different from the natural logarithm) is constant, but it is not equal to the growth. 1.4.3 Rule of 70 Assuming a variable \\(y\\) grows at a comppund average growth rate \\(g\\), how many years \\(t\\) does it take for it to double in value? We just saw how plotting a variable using a log scale allows us to see immediately how long it would take for a variable to double (or triple, quadruple, etc…). It is also possible to address this question numerically using a useful result known as the rule of 70. Rule of 70: if a variable \\(y\\) grows at the rate of \\(\\%g\\) per period, then it takes approximately \\(t \\approx \\frac{70}{\\%g}\\) periods for the value of \\(y\\) to double. Proof: let \\(y_t\\) be such that it is twice the initial income per capita level \\(y_0\\) and \\(t\\) be the number of periods it takes for income per capita to double. Using \\(y_t = (1+g)^{t} y_0\\): \\[y_t = (1+g)^ty_0 = 2 \\times y_0 \\quad \\rightarrow 2 = (1+g)^t \\] Taking logs on both sides: \\[ \\ln{2} = t \\times \\ln{(1+g)}\\] Using the fact that \\(\\ln{2} \\approx 0.7\\) and \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\) (for small values of g): \\[t = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{\\ln{(1+g)}} \\approx \\frac{0.7}{g} = \\frac{70}{\\%g}\\] So when \\(y\\) grows at rate \\(g=0.05\\) in each period as in our example, the formula predicts that it would take approximately \\(\\frac{70}{5}=14\\) periods for it to double, in line with what we observed in Figure 1.8. Example: GDP per capita in the United States (1870-2022) Figure 1.9: GDP per capita in the United States (in 2011$): normal and logarithmic scale Figure 1.9 illustrates how this tool can be used to analyse the behaviour of GDP per capita over time. The right panel shows that it took slightly more than 35 years for GDP per capita to double in the United States, consistent with the prediction of the rule of 70 that when GDP per capita is growing at the trend rate of 1.67%, it will take about 42 years to double. 1.5 Growth in the United Kingdom and the United States Figure 1.10: GDP per capita in the United States and United Kingdom: 1800-2022 Figure 1.10 suggests that on average GDP per capita in the United States grew faster than in the United Kingdom over the last 200 years. However, some questions are less easily answered just by looking at this plot. First, was the growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States and the United Kingdom constant over time or were there periods of faster (slower) growth? Second, was GDP per capita in the United States always growing at a faster rate than in the United Kingdom over these two centuries or only during specific periods? We can address these questions using the techniques developed in the previous sections. Figure 1.11 plots the logarithm of GDP per capita for both countries and can be used to identify subperiods. Table 1.2 presents estimates of the trend growth rates of GDP per capita for both the United States and the United Kingdom for the full sample period and four subperiods. Figure 1.11: United States vs United Kingdom: GDP per capita (1800-2022) Table 1.2: UK and US: Average growth rates over different subperiods Period United states United Kingdom 1800-2022 1.42 1.11 1800-1830 0.59 0.20 1830-1946 1.38 0.96 1946-2022 1.82 1.69 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023. Compound average annual growth rates (%). Did the two economies grow at a constant rate over the last two centuries or were there periods of faster or slower growth? Growth accelerated in both countries after 1830. Although the United States grew at a relatively constant rate between 1830 and 2022 (between 1.4% and 1.8%), the growth experience of the United Kingdom is relatively more uneven. Its GDP per capita grew significantly faster on average in the second part of the 20th century (1.7%) compared to the previous period (1%). Can we identify periods when GDP per capita in the United States grew at a substantially faster rate than that of the United Kingdom? GDP per capita grew at relatively similar rates in the two countries between 1946 and 2022, which can be seen both in the log plot and the estimated average gowth rates. However, between 1830 and 1946, GDP per capita grew at a substantially higher average growth rate in the United States, which is the period when US GDP per capita overtook UK GDP per capita. In this period, the average growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States is 0.4 percentage point higher than that of the United Kingdom between 1830 and 1946. This relatively small difference on an annual basis explains why, by the end of this period, US GDP per capita was almost 50% higher than that of the UK, having started at a lower level (See Figure 1.10). Summary The growth rate of variable \\(y\\) is defined as the percentage change of \\(y\\) between any two consecutive periods \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\\%g_t=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \\times 100 \\] When a variable follows an exponential growth pattern, the compound annual growth rate provides a useful measure of the average growth rate over an interval of time. It is calculated as: \\[ \\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{y_t}{y_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \\] where \\(\\bar{g}\\) is the average growth rate and \\(y_0\\) is the initial value of \\(y\\). Compounding effect of growth: growth in each period derives from growth achieved in the previous period. This explains why relatively small differences in annual growth rates between countries may lead to large differences in the level of macroeconomic variables in the long-run. Two useful approximations (provided growth rates are small) of these growth rates are based on transformations using logarithms: \\(g_t \\approx \\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_{t-1}}\\) and \\(\\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_0})\\) Plots of logarithms are particularly well suited to describe growth trends: The slope of the plot of the logarithm of a variable provides a good approximation of the growth rate of this series at any point in time. The plot of the logarithm of a variable represents how many times this variable is multiplied by a given factor (\\(e\\) in the case of the natural logarithm) over a certain interval of time. The rule of 70 states states that it takes approximately \\(70 / \\%g\\) periods for a variable growing at rate \\(\\%g\\) to double.

Divide the sample period into three subperiods based on what happened to the growth rate of GDP per capita. In which period did GDP per capita grow the fastest? In which period did GDP per capita in Indonesia grow at the slowest pace? Question 8 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023 The figure above represents GDP per capita in Indonesia on a ratio scale. Based on this figure, how many years did it take approximately for GDP per capita to double in Indonesia over this period? Using your answer in a., provide an approximation for the average annual growth rate using the rule of 70. Question 9 The rule of 70 gives the number of years it would take for a variable to double given their annual growth rate. But we could derive similar formulas to calculate the number of years it would take for a variable to triple, quadruple, …, given their average annual growth rate. Derive an expression for the number of years it would take for a variable to be multiplied by 6 given an annual growth rate \\(\\%g\\). Hint: use the following approximation \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\) (for small g). In the introduction we saw that GDP per capita in the UK and Nigeria have been multiplied by about 6 between 1885 and 2022. Using the expression derived in a., find an estimate of the average annual growth rate in the two countries over this period. 1.7 Exercises with Copilot Although any large language model (LLM) can be used to do this exercise, we recommend using Microsoft Copilot for Edge browser, which is free of charge to all students through the University Microsoft license, to do these exercises.

Appendix 1: Continuous time notation Discrete versus continuous time change In this chapter, we have not made much use of the continuous time notation, preferring to describe the behaviour of variables in discrete time. This reflects the fact that most macroeconomic variables are observed in discrete time. In the discrete time perspective, variables remain unchanged during the interval between two time periods. In the continuous time perspective, variables remain unchanged for an infinitesimally short amount of time. This leads to different ways of expressing the change in these variables. For a more precise definition of these two concepts see here. The continuous time change in variable \\(y\\) at \\(t\\) is the instantaneous change in \\(y\\) at time \\(t\\). It is defined as the change in variable \\(y\\) between two time periods as the interval of time between these two time periods tends to 0. In other terms, it is the derivative of the variable \\(y\\) with respect to time, denoted \\(\\dot{y}_t\\) and defined as: \\[\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-\\Delta t}}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\dot{y}_t\\] In this course, we will formulate economic models using the discrete time notation. The continuous time notation presents analytical advantages and for this reason is often employed in growth models and in textbooks. Continuous time growth rate The continuous time counterpart to the growth rate formula described above is the instantaneous growth rate or proportional change. The instantaneous growth rate of variable \\(x\\) at time \\(t\\) is calculated as the ratio of the instantaneous change in \\(x\\) and its initial value: \\[g_{t}=\\frac{\\dot{x}_t}{x_t} \\] Compounding growth rate Assume a variable \\(y\\) (GDP, population, …) has initial value \\(y_0\\) and grows at the constant rate \\(g\\). Continuous compounding corresponds to the case where the frequency of compounding (\\(n\\) times a year) becomes infinitely large. Assuming continuous compounding, after \\(t\\) periods its value is equal to: \\[ y_t = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{g}{n}\\right)^{nt} = e^{gt} y_0\\] where \\(e = 271828...\\) is Euler’s number. By taking the logarithm of this expression and rearranging, we obtain the following formula for the constant continuous time trend growth rate: \\[ g = \\frac{1}{t}\\times(\\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_0})\\] Growth rate and logarithm Assume a variable \\(y\\) has initial value \\(y_0\\) and grows at the continuously compounded constant rate \\(g\\), ie it follows this process: \\(y_t = e^{gt} y_0\\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the continuous compounding expression and using the rules of logarithms: \\[\\ln{y_t}=\\ln{e^{gt}}+\\ln{y_0}=g\\times t + \\ln{y_0} = C + g \\times t\\] Where \\(C=\\ln{y_0}\\) (constant). This expression tells us that the logarithm of variable \\(y\\) can be expressed as a linear function of time \\(t\\). This implies that if a variable is growing at a constant rate, then the plot of its logarithm against time is a straight line. Moreover, the slope of this plot represents the (continuous time) growth rate of this variable.

We will use data from the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and P.Timmer 2015), which allow us to compare real economic outcomes over time and across countries. All macroeconomic outcomes described, such as GDP, and capital stock, are real outcomes although this may not be explicitly mentioned for simplicity in the text. 2.1 Introduction The starting point of growth theory is the assumption that there are three main proximate causes of long-term growth in output: technological progress, the accumulation of capital and improvements in the size and skills of the labour force. Growth theories attempt to understand the forces that drive these factors over time as well as their interactions by making assumptions regarding the behaviour of households and firms. In this chapter, we will present the growth accounting methodology, which is a method developed by economists to quantify the relative importance of these factors, and apply it to the case of labour productivity growth in South Korea. (#fig:plot1 )Figure 1: South Korea: 1953-2019 Figure 1 shows that the strong growth in output per worker that occurred in South Korea between the 1960s and 1990s was also associated with a strong growth in the capital-labour ratio. This raises the following questions: What has been the role of capital accumulation in the growth of labour productivity in South Korea over this period? Was capital accumulation the main determinant of labour productivity growth or were there other factors that played more important roles? The neoclassical production function states that output per hour can increase either if the capital-labour ratio (or capital per hour) increases or if total factor productivity (TFP) increases. The capital-labour ratio captures the intensity with which capital is employed in production. It is a better measure of the importance of capital accumulation than the capital stock, which would also be expected to increase with population. An increase in the capital-labour ratio implies that the capital stock is growing at a faster rate than the labour input. Total factor productivity includes any factor that improves the efficiency of the economy at combining capital and labour in order to produce total output. An increase in total factor productivity may consist in technological innovations such as the diffusion of software packages which dramatically decreased the time spent performing some administrative tasks or computations, or in the implementation of better management techniques, or a reallocation of capital and skills in more productive sectors or the most productive firms within a sector, etc… Growth accounting can be used to provide a rough description of the growth of output per hour over a given interval of time in terms of the relative contribution of capital accumulation and total factor productivity growth. This method allowed R. Solow (1956) to assign close to 88% of the growth in output per hour in the US in the first part of the 20th century to TFP growth and the remaining 12% to capital accumulation. Since then economists have refined the methodology to allow for more precise estimates using more precise decompositions taking into account the role played by different types of capital and the different skill levels of the workforce in different sectors. The major role assigned to TFP growth in developed economies remains the key result obtained through this type of exercise. Another important contribution of growth accounting is to provide one method to estimate total factor productivity growth, a factor that is difficult to observe or measure, and even still difficult to explain. Although growth accounting can yield some powerful insights, its ability to describe accurately the underlying economic mechanisms depends on strong assumptions, the failure of which may cast doubt on the conclusions that can be drawn from these calculations. In the next sections, we will explain how we arrive at the growth accounting decomposition and illustrate the use of this methodology by examining the case of labour productivity growth in South Korea between 1953 and 2019. 2.2 Growth accounting equation In order to structure our investigation of the relative contributions of the factor inputs to the growth of output, we need to use a theoretical framework to organise our thoughts. Whether the results of a growth accounting provides a good picture of the growth experience of a country over a given period depends on how good an approximation these assumptions are for the economy in question at the moment of time considered. 2.2.1 Derivation Assumption 1: Cobb-Douglas production function \\[Y_t=A_tK_t^\\beta L_t^{1-\\beta}\\] where \\(Y_t\\) is Real GDP, \\(K_t\\) is the capital stock (structures, transport and communication equipment, computers, software, machinery, …), \\(L_t\\) is the quantity of labour input (measured in number of workers, number of hours worked, hours worked adjusted for labour quality, …) and \\(A_t\\) is the stock of technology (may capture technological progress, the allocation of resources in the economy, the organisation of labour and management practices, …). Note that all variables are a function of time (they have a time subscript \\(t\\)). \\(\\beta\\) is the elasticity of output with respect to capital and assumed to be constant and \\(0&lt;\\beta&lt;1\\). The Cobb-Douglas production function exhibits constant returns to scale and diminishing returns to both capital and labour. It also embodies the idea of a complementarity between capital and labour in production: more of each input, holding the other constant, increases the productivity of the other input. Since we are interested in the growth of labour productivity (or output per worker), which is more informative about living standards than total output, we rewrite the Cobb-Douglas production function in intensive form as: \\[y_t=A_tk_t^\\beta \\] where \\(y\\) is output per hour (labour productivity) and \\(k\\) is the capital-labour ratio. We are interested in growth rates. How can we express the relationship between the growth rate of labour productivity (\\(g_y\\)) and the growth rates of the capital-labour ratio (\\(g_k\\)) and total factor productivity growth (\\(g_A\\)) implied by this production function? By taking the logs. Taking the logarithm on both sides of the production function: \\[\\ln{y_t} = ln{A_t} + \\beta \\ln{k_t}\\] where we use the following properties of logarithms: \\(\\ln{ab} = \\ln{a} + \\ln{b}\\) and \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\ln{a} - \\ln{b}\\). Subtracting \\(\\ln{y_{t-1}} = ln{A_{t-1}} + \\beta \\ln{k_{t-1}}\\) from the previous expression yields: \\[\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{t-1}}= ln{A_t} - ln{A_{t-1}} + \\beta (\\ln{k_t} - \\ln{k_{t-1}})\\] Using the approximation \\(g_{x,t} \\approx \\ln{x_t} - \\ln{x_{t-1}}\\) which holds for small values of \\(g_{x,t}\\) (see Chapter 1): \\[g_{y,t}= g_{A,t} + \\beta g_{k,t}\\] where \\(\\beta g_{k,t}\\) is the contribution of capital accumulation and \\(g_{A,t}\\) is the contribution of TFP growth to labour productivity growth. 2.2.2 Estimation National accounts provide data on GDP, labour and capital from which we can easily recover estimates for \\(g_y\\) and \\(g_k\\). To obtain estimates of the elasticity of capita \\(\\beta\\), several options are possible: Set it equal to 0.3 as a rule of thumb. Recent studies (Vollrath, 2024) have shown that for the United States, this elasticity has been relatively constant around 0.2-0.3. To obtain such estimates, the authors of these studies do not rely on the assumption of perfect competition in the product markets but still need to make additional assumptions, such that firms choose the quantity of inputs that are cost minimising. This elasticity may be expected to be relatively similar in other developed economies. However, they may differ significantly in developing economies. Use data on the labour share of income, provided in National accounts, from which it is possible to recover an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) as (\\(1 - \\text{labour share of income}\\)). This relies on the assumption that markets are perfectly competitive, hence firms make zero profits, the wage and rental rate of capital are equal to their marginal products and, assuming constant returns to scale, total income is equal to the sum of the income distributed to labour and capital as a reward for their services. If product markets are not competitive so that firms have the ability to set the price of their final products, then this method will tend to overestimate the elasticity of capital. The default value of \\(\\beta\\) in all the examples will be 0.3. But it will be possible to experiment with different values of \\(\\beta\\) to check the robustness of results. Finally, total factor productivity growth is not directly observed but can be estimated as the residual of the growth accounting equation: \\[ g_{A,t}= g_{y,t} - \\beta g_{k,t} \\] 2.3 Case study: South Korea (1953-2019) The table and chart below present the same growth accounting results for South Korea over the period 1953-2019 in two different ways. Growth rates are compound annual growth rates. Interpretation and discussion Labour productivity over the full sample period grew at the average annual rate of 4.7%; this is faster than the growth in US labour productivity. This is indicating that the economy of South Korea was converging towards the US level of labour productivity. South Korea experienced a period of fast growth growing at an average rate of about 6% per year for about 50 years between the 1960s and 2000s. Its growth has since more than halved to less than 3%, similarly to other developed economies. The growth of capital per hour contributed 1.4% towards the growth of labour productivity and TFP growth contributed the remaining 3.3%. TFP growth was therefore the main factor of growth over the full sample period, contributing about 70% of the growth in labour productivity and capital accumulation the remaining 30%. These shares remained remarkably constant over all subperiods. These results suggest that the key to understanding the growth experience of South Korea is to look into the drivers of TFP growth. In particular, it might be interesting to disentangle the role of human capital accumulation (education, on-the-job-training, …) from other factors of total factor productivity growth. This would allow us to determine how much weight was given in the growth strategy to the accumulation of factors of production as opposed to increases in efficiency. This could provide some clue as to the recent slowdown in TFP growth. 2.4 Exercise (Week 14) This exercise guides you through the growth accounting decomposition of UK labour productivity as seen in the lecture slides in week 13, then ask you to do the same for US labour productivity and to finally compare the results for the two countries. In order to perform these practice questions, you need to work on a laptop or a desktop computer (if possible using a mouse), not a tablet. You also need to have installed Excel on your device (you may not be able to perform all the operations using the web version). Part 1: Preliminaries Download and learn more about the Penn World Table database by checking the information on this website: PWT. [You may also look up this prompt in Copilot: “Explain what the Penn World Table data is, what is its significance, who is responsible for it and what are its objectives”.] If you have not done so already, go through the Penn World Table in Excel tutorial (click on blue link to access it) which shows how to perform basic operations and growth accounting using the Penn World Table dataset in Excel and make sure you are able to replicate the results. Part 2: Describing long-run trends in productivity Create a new Excel sheet with the following variables for the United Kingdom: “rgdpna”, “rnna”, “pop”, “emp”, “avh” and “labsh”. Check the variable definitions in the “Legend” sheet. In a new column, create a new variable for labour productivity labelled “y” using “rgdpna”, “emp” and “avh”. Then create the (natural) logarithm of this variable, labelled “lny”. Make a plot of the logarithm of UK labour productivity. You may add a trendline and its equation. Can you identify the three subperiods described in the week 13 slides? Repeat 1 to 3 using data for the United States. Compare the trends in labour productivity growth in the two countries. Note: Table 1 (p 3154) in Feenstra et al. (link) explains why “rgdpna” is the appropriate real GDP variable to study the growth of GDP over time in a single country. Part 3: Growth accounting decompositions In this part, you will perform the growth accounting decomposition of labour productivity growth in the UK and the US. We will use the following growth accounting equation: \\[ g_y = g_A + \\beta g_k \\] where \\(g_y\\) is the growth rate of labour productivity, \\(g_k\\) is the growth rate of the capital-labour ratio, \\(g_A\\) is the growth rate of total factor productivity and \\(\\beta\\) is the elasticity of output with respect to capital. We will assume that \\(\\beta = 0.3\\) initially. Annual growth accounting decompositions: In a new column, create a new variable for the capital-labour ratio (capital per hour worked) labelled “k” using “rnna”, “emp” and “avh”. In two new columns, create the annual growth rate of “y” (labelled “gy”) and the annual growth rate of “k” (labelled “gk”). In two new columns, create the annual contribution of capital accumulation (labelled “bgk”) by multiplying “gk” by \\(\\beta = 0.3\\) in each year and the annual growth rate of total factor productivity (labelled “gA”) as the residual from the growth accounting equation: \\(g_A = g_y - \\beta g_k\\). Make a line plot of “gy”, “bgk” and “gA” and interpret the results. Growth accounting decompositions over intervals of time: In Excel, construct a table as in the Excel tutorial - Section 7.4 containing the full sample period and each subperiod identified in Part 2 in each row. Hint: use the compound growth rate formula, \\(g_{x,t-s} = \\left(\\frac{x_s}{x_t}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{s-t}}-1\\), to calculate average growth rates between any two periods \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) in this exercise. Column 1: calculate the average annual growth rate of UK labour productivity (\\(g_y\\)) over the full sample period and over each subperiod. Column 2: calculate the average annual growth rate of the UK capital-labour (\\(g_k\\)) over the full sample period and over each subperiod. Column 3: calculate the contribution of capital accumulation to UK labour productivity (\\(\\beta g_k\\)) over the full sample period and over each subperiod. Column 4: calculate the contribution of TFP growth to UK labour productivity (\\(g_A\\)) over the full sample period and over each subperiod as the residual of the growth accounting equation: \\(g_A = g_y - \\beta g_k\\). Construct a table (as below) and a column chart to summarize the results of the UK labour productivity growth accounting over the full sample period and each subperiod (see the video in PWT Excel tutorial - Section 7.4 for how to construct the column chart). Repeat 1 to 5 for the US using the same subperiods. Compare the growth accounting results in the two countries. (optional) Repeat 1 to 6 using the the average of the “labsh” variable to obtain an estimate of the elasticity of capital \\(\\beta\\). Under what assumption is this a valid method of estimation for \\(\\beta\\)? How do the results change when using this alternative measure of \\(\\beta\\)? gy bgk gA 1950-2019 First subperiod Second subperiod Third subperiod Part 4: Sources of changes in labour productivity This will be covered in the class if time permits. Based on your results in the previous part, investigate the possible underlying causes explaining the differences in capital accumulation and TFP growth between the two countries over the full sample period or in some subperiod. These underlying causes may refer to differences in economic or political context (eg the UK faced higher reconstruction costs than the US in 1950), differences in household behaviour, differences in policies, … Can you identify one or two arguments to explain some differences in labour productivity growth trends you have identified in Part 3 between the United Kingdom and the United States? Can you provide one or two academic sources providing support to these arguments? To address this question, you may use these two resources: The university library contains the most extensive database of academic papers at your disposal and more resources. Click on this link to start exploring. You may use Copilot as a starting point. A useful prompt: “Can you provide 5 differences between the United Kingdom and the United States which may be related to the wider economic context, policies or the behaviour of households and firms which may explain the lower capital accumulation of capital stock per worker in the US relative to the UK between 1950 and 1973? Can you provide detailed academic sources in support of each argument you make in this answer?” Retain only the most promising arguments and check the sources! 2.5 Exercise: Formative assessment (Week 15) Part 1: Preliminaries Before attempting this exercise: Check your team allocation in the Group formative assessment folder on Blackboard –&gt; Learning Materials. Agree with your team on the pair of countries you want to focus in your formative assessment. Do not choose randomly a pair of countries. Here are some ideas to help guide your choice: Select a pair of countries satisfying the conditions stated in Country selection (Formative brief). Select a pair of countries which you think may offer an interesting contrast (different policies, political institutions, economic success, …) but are similar enough that they may lead to meaningful comparisons (similar sizes, institutions, shared initial or final level of labour productivity, shocks or external events, region, economic specialisation, shared past …). Part 2: Growth accounting Each team member should do this on their own: Make two plots describing labour productivity growth in each countries. Identify 2 to 4 subperiods. Produce growth accounting results for the two countries over the full sample period and the same subperiods. Compare the results of your analysis for the two countries. List the similarities and differences in the growth trends and growth accounting results. Does this comparison suggest some interesting questions, ideas, differences worthy of investigation? Part 3: Sources of changes in labour productivity Can you identify one or two arguments to explain some differences in labour productivity growth trends you have identified in Part 2 between your two countries? Can you provide one or two academic sources providing support to these arguments? To address this question, you may use these two resources: The university library contains the most extensive database of academic papers at your disposal and more resources. Click on this link to start exploring. You may use Copilot as a starting point. An example of a prompt you might use (applied to the example of the US and UK in the previous exercise): “Can you provide 5 differences between the United Kingdom and the United States which may be related to the wider economic context, policies or the behaviour of households and firms which may explain the reduce role of capital accumulation in the US relative to the UK between 1950 and 1973? Can you provide detailed academic sources in support of each argument you make in this answer?” Make a list of the most promising arguments, check that they can all be linked to some academic sources!

A good understanding of these is required to perform model simulations.

An integrated approach, 2nd Ed., The MIT Press: Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 3. 3.2 Model setup 3.2.1 The markets for goods, capital and labour Assume an economy where a single output good is produced by firms. Households purchase this good in the good market and decide either to consume it or to save it, in which case it becomes instantaneously a capital/investment good. This output good is also the unit of measurement in this economy, so its price is normalised to one (\\(P=1\\)) and all the other prices (wage and interest rate) are expressed in units of output good. Firms produce the output good using two factor inputs: capital and labour. The price of renting the capital stock is the interest rate (or rental rate) \\(r\\) and the price of hiring labour is the wage \\(w\\). Firms hire labour and capital from households in the market for capital and labour. We assume that the markets for capital and labour are perfectly competitive so that both firms and households take the wage and the interest rate as given when making their labour and capital demand and supply decisions. In other words, individual firms and households do not have the power to affect these prices. Such a situation may arise because there are infinitely many firms and households competing for jobs and workers or because of free market entry. 3.2.2 Production technology The aggregate production function is assumed to take the form of the Cobb-Douglas production function: \\[ Y_t =A K_t^{\\beta}L_t^{1-\\beta} \\quad [\\text{Total output}]\\] where \\(Y_t\\) is total output, \\(K_t\\) is the total capital stock, \\(L\\) is the total amount of labour input (number of workers or hours) \\(A\\) is total factor productivity (or multifactor productivity) and \\(\\beta\\) is the elasticity of output with respect to capital (the elasticity of output with respect to labour is \\(1-\\beta\\)). This production function exhibits two important properties: Property 1: Constant returns to scale: Increasing both capital and labour by the same percentage leads to an equal percentage change in output. \\[ A(\\lambda K_t)^\\beta(\\lambda L_t)^{1-\\beta}= \\lambda A K_t^{\\beta}L_t^{1-\\beta} \\] Property 2: Diminishing returns to capital and labour: \\[MPK= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{L_t}{K_t}\\right)^{1-\\beta} \\] The marginal product of capital is the amount by which total output increases when the capital stock increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of labour input. It is decreasing with the size of the capital stock and increasing with the amount of labour input. In other words, the higher the level of the capital stock, the lower its return and the higher the labour input the higher the marginal productivity of capital. \\[MPL= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L} = (1-\\beta) \\left(\\frac{K_t}{L_t}\\right)^{\\beta} \\] The marginal product of labour is the amount by which total output increases when the labour input increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of capital. It is decreasing with the ampunt of labour input used and increasing with the level of the capital stock. In other words, the more labour is used in production, the lower its return and the higher the capital stock, the higher the marginal productivity of labour. Because our focus will be on labour productivity, we will expressed the Cobb-Douglas production function in intensive form: \\[ y_t =A k_t^{\\beta} \\quad [\\text{Labour productivity}]\\] where \\(y = \\frac{Y}{L}\\) is labour productivity (output per worker/hour) and \\(k= \\frac{K}{L}\\) is the capital-labour ratio (the amount of capital per unit of labour used). 3.3 Firms’ demand for capital and labour In each periods, firms choose the amount of capital and labour employed that maximises their profits, taking as given \\(\\bar{w}_t\\) and \\(\\bar{r}_t\\) (perfectly competitive markets). Firms’ profit maximisation problem: \\[\\max_{L,K} \\pi = PY_t - \\bar{w}_tL_t-\\bar{r}_tK_t\\] where \\(Py=Y\\) is total revenue, \\(\\bar{w}L\\) is total labour costs and \\(\\bar{r}K\\) is total capital costs, Firms’ optimal demand for capital and labour satisfy the condition that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost: \\(MR = MC\\) Firms’ demand for capital: \\[MPK= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K} =\\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} = \\bar{r}_t\\] Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of capital is just equal to the market interest rate. Assuming the interest rate is equal to \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), the optimal demand for capital is given by \\(K_2\\). To see why any other amount of capital stock would not be optimal, let’s consider two cases: A higher capital stock would imply a lower marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), so firms would be making a loss. Firms would be able to reduce their loss by reducing their capital stock. A lower capital stock would imply a higher marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), so firms would be making a positive profit. Firms would be able to increase their profit by increasing their capital stock by a marginal amount. Firms’ demand for labour: \\[MPL= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L} = (1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} = \\bar{w}_t \\] Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of labour is just equal to the market wage. Assuming the wgae is equal to \\(\\bar{w}_2\\), the optimal demand for labour is given by \\(L_2\\). Following the same reasoning as for capital, it is possible to show that any other amount of labour would not be optimal. 3.4 Households’ supply for capital and labour 3.4.1 Setup We assume that households live for 2 periods (about 30 years each), so at any point in time they are either “young” or “old”. Households who are young in one period become old in the second period, while a new generation of young households arrives. The diagram below shows how the generations overlap over time. We further assume that there is no population growth, and at any point in time there are \\(N\\) members of the young generation and \\(N\\) members of the old generation. “Young” households start life with zero assets, work full-time and earn labour income \\(w\\). At the end of the first period they decide how much of their income to consume, and how much to save. When they save they accumulate the assets that they will hold at the beginning of the net period. More formally, “young” households supply labour, \\(N\\), earn the market wage \\(\\bar{w}\\), consume \\(c_{y,t}\\) and accumulate assets \\(a_{t+1}\\). This gives us the total supply of labour in the economy: \\[N \\quad [\\text{Labour supply}]\\] “Old” households do not work (they are retired). At the beginning of the period, they invest their assets in their own firms, employ young households to produce output, pay young households wage payments and keep the rest as capital income. At the end of the period they consume all their assets and capital income and end life with zero assets. More formally, “old” households, invest their assets \\(a_{t+1}\\) as capital and earn capital income \\(\\bar{r}_{t+1}a_{t+1}\\) and consume all their capital and income at the end of the period, \\(c_{o,t+1}\\). This gives us the total supply of capital in the economy as the sum of all the assets accumulated by the old generation at the end of the previous period: \\[K_{t+1} = Na_{t+1} \\quad [\\text{Capital supply}]\\] 3.4.2 Households’ problem Because there is no uncertainty in the model, households decide on their consumption levels for both periods of their lives at the beginning of their lifetime. More precisely, households’ choices of how much to consume when young and when old maximise their lifetime utility subject to their intertemporal budget constraint. 3.4.3 The intertemporal budget constraint Young households’ budget constraint: \\[ c_{y,t} + a_{t+1} = w_t\\] Old households’ budget constraint: \\[c_{o,t+1}= (1+r_{t+1})a_{t+1} \\quad [\\text{Old household consumption}]\\] Combining the two, we obtain the intertemporal budget constraint: \\[ c_{y,t} + \\frac{c_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}= w_t \\] which states that the present value of consumption when young and old (left-hand side) should be equal to the present value of lifetime income (right-hand side), where \\(\\frac{1}{1+r_{t+1}}\\) is the price of consumption when old at the beginning of life. The intertemporal budget constraint represents the set of combinations of consumption when young and when old that are achievable, for given \\(w\\) and \\(r\\). The diagram makes it clear that the rate at which consumption when young can be traded for consumption when old is \\(1+r_{t+1}\\). 3.4.4 Lifetime utility Households preferences for consumption over their lifetime takes the form of a Cobb-Douglas utility function: \\[u_t = c_{y,t}^{\\alpha} c_{o,t+1}^{1-\\alpha} \\] where \\(u_t\\) is the lifetime utility of a typical member of the generation born at time \\(t\\) and \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\) is the key preference parameter, assumed to be constant and capturing how much households value consumption when young relative to consumption when old. Lifetime utility is also a measure of the welfare of each generation, which depends only on their consumption levels in both periods here. Important properties of this utility function: Utility is increasing in both consumption when young and consumption when old. Diminishing marginal utility of consumption: as seen on the diagram, the marginal rate of substitution between \\(c_{y,t}\\) and \\(c_{o,t+1}\\), ie the rate at which households would be willing to substitute consumption when young for consumption when old is decreasing. 3.4.5 Optimal consumption and saving decision Households’ optimal consumption choices satisfies: \\[ MRS = -\\frac{MU{cy,t}}{MU{co,t+1}} = - (1+r_{t+1}) \\quad [\\text{Tangency condition}]\\] \\[ c_{y,t} + \\frac{c_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}= w_t \\quad [\\text{Intertemporal budget constraint}]\\] Solving for \\(c_{y,t}\\) and \\(a_{t+1}\\) yields: \\[c_{y,t} = \\alpha w_t \\quad [\\text{Young household consumption}]\\] \\[a_{t+1}= (1- \\alpha) w_t \\quad [\\text{Young household saving = Assets when old}]\\] 3.4.6 Saving and investment So far we have solved for the saving of “young” households separately. We turn now to the measure of national saving. Saving of the “young” households at time \\(t\\): \\[ S_{y,t} = Na_{t+1} \\] Saving of the “old” households at time \\(t\\): \\[ S_{o,t} = r_tNa_t - N(1+r_t)a_t = - Na_t \\] where the first term (\\(r_tNa_t\\)) is total capital income earned by all the members of the “old” generation at time \\(t\\) and the second term (\\(N(1+r_t)a_t\\)) is the total consumption by the members of the “old” generation at time \\(t\\). National saving (\\(S_t\\)) is equal to the sum of the saving of the young and old households at any given point in time: \\[S_t = S_{y,t} + S_{o,t} = Na_{t+1} - Na_t = K_{t+1} - K_t = I_t\\] where investment (\\(I_t\\)) is equal to the change in the capital stock between the current period and the next (\\(K_{t+1} - K_t\\)) assuming capital does not depreciates. At any point in time, national investment is equal to national saving. Given that output must be equal to the sum of consumption and investment (\\(Y_t=C_t+I_t\\)), this is equivalent to saying that the good market is in equilibrium. 3.5 Equilibrium Having discussed the supply and demand sides of the economy, we are now in a position to solve for the equilibrium values of the key variables of our model, labour productivity, the capital-labour ratio, the wage, the interest and consumption when young and when old. 3.5.1 Equilibrium in the market for capital and labour Equilibrium in the labour and capital markets is achieved when demand is equal to supply. The demand for labour is decreasing in the wage whereas the supply of labour is fixed (\\(N\\)) and independent of the wage. Therefore, equilibrium labour input (\\(L_t\\)) is equal to the fixed labour supply: \\[L_t = N \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium labour}]\\] and the equilibrium wage is equal to the marginal product of labour at this equilibrium value of labour: \\[MPL= (1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} = w_t \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium wage}]\\] Equilibrium wage is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio \\(k_t\\) and TFP \\(A\\). The higher the capital-labour ratio or TFP, the more productive is an additional unit of labour input and the higher the wage. The demand for capital is decreasing in the interest rate whereas the current supply of capital per worker is independent of the interest rate and is determined by the savings of the “old” generation in the previous period, which in turns is determined by the wage received by the old generation in the previous period: \\[K_t = Na_t = N(1-\\alpha)w_{t-1} \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium capital stock}]\\] Therefore, the equilibrium capital input (\\(K_t\\)) is equal to its supply of capital at the beginning of the current period, and similarly for the equilibrium capital-labour ratio: \\[k_t = (1-\\alpha)w_{t-1} \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium capital-labour ratio}]\\] The equilibrium interest rate is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio \\(k_t\\) and TFP \\(A\\). \\[MPK= \\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} = r_t \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium interest rate}]\\] 3.5.2 The transition equation Derivation Because output and labour productivity depend on the capital stock (\\(K\\)), labour (\\(L\\)) and total factor productivity (\\(A\\)) and the last two are fixed parameters, only changes in the capital stock can explain changes in growth in this model economy. The transition equation is the key equilibrium condition of this model. The intuition for this equation is provided by the discussion in the previous section. What determines the capital stock in each period? The capital-labour ratio at time \\(t+1\\) (\\(k_{t+1}\\)) is determined by the assets accumulated by households of the “old” generation in the previous period (\\(a_{t+1}\\)), which was determined by the wage they earned in the previous period (\\(w_t\\)), which in turn was determined by the previous period capital-labour ratio (\\(k_t\\)). The transition equation makes this link between current and future capital-labour ratio appear more clearly: \\[k_{t+1} = a_{t+1} =(1-\\alpha)w_t = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} \\] The equilibrium value of the capital-labour ratio at any point in time \\(t+1\\) depends on the fixed parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(A\\) and on its value at time \\(t\\). In order to solve for the equilibrium values of \\(k_t\\) at each point in time, \\(t=0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\), we also need to know its initial value \\(k_0\\). The transition path diagram The transition path diagram represents the equilibrium values of \\(k_{t+1}\\) for all the possible values that can be taken by \\(k_t\\). The straight line is a 45-degree line whereby \\(k_{t+1}=k_t\\). To understand the dynamics of the equilibrium capital ratio, we can trace its time path starting with any initial value \\(k_0\\). The diagram represents one such time path. Starting from the initial value \\(k_0\\), the capital stock increases at \\(t=1\\) as the transition equation is above the 45-degree line. In the next period, starting with an initial value \\(k_1\\), the capital stock keeps increasing as the transition equation is still above the 45-degree line. This continues until the capital ratio reaches the value \\(\\bar{k}\\), at which point it remains constant. It is possible to show that starting at an initial value \\(k_0\\) above \\(\\bar{k}\\) would lead it to converge down towards \\(\\bar{k}\\) over time. \\(\\bar{k}\\) is the steady state value of the capital stock. It represents the equilibrium value of the capital ratio in the long-run. Why is the capital-labour ratio converging to a constant value? Assume for now that \\(\\alpha=0.5\\), so that young households save half of their first period labour income (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t\\)). For the capital stock to increase, young households’ savings must be higher than the current capital stock (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t&gt;k_t\\)). As the capital stock increases, the wage increases but by less and less with each additional increase in the capital stock (due to diminishing returns) and therefore so does the increase in the savings of the young. As the additional savings generated by an additional unit of capital falls over time, it will arrive a point where the savings of the young are just equal to the current capital stock (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t=k_t\\)). At this point, the saving of the young in each period is just enough to maintain the capital stock at the same level in each period. The capital stock will stabilise at this level and the economy will stop growing. 3.5.3 The full equilibrium In the previous section, We have seen how to calculate the equilibrium values of the capital ratio as function of the exogenous parameters of the model: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\). Once we have the equilibrium value of the capital ratio, it is possible to solve for the values of all the other endogenous variables of the model using the following relationships: \\[y_t = Ak_t^\\beta\\] \\[K_t = k_tN \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Y_t = y_tN\\] \\[ I_t = K_{t+1}-K_t \\] \\[ r_t = \\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} \\] \\[ w_t = (1-\\beta) Ak_t^{\\beta} \\] \\[c_{y,t}= \\alpha w_t \\] \\[a_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha) w_t \\] \\[c_{o,t+1}= (1 + r_{t+1}) a_{t+1} \\] \\[S_t = Y_t - Nc_{y,t} -Nc_{o,t} \\] 3.5.4 The steady state The steady state is defined as the long-run position towards which the economy converges, or the long run equilibrium. In the model without technological progress, it corresponds to a situation in which the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity remain constant. Using the transition equation and this definition, it is possible to solve for the steady state value of the capital ratio \\(\\bar{k}\\): \\[ \\bar{k} = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A \\bar{k}^{\\beta}\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\bar{k} = [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}} \\] 3.6 Analysis of shocks The exogenous parameters of the model (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\)) capture charateristics of the economic environment which may change as a result of shocks occurring outside of the model. For example, \\(\\alpha\\) captures the propensity to consume when young relative to when old and affects directly the share of labour income saved by young households, and therefore capital accumulation. This parameter may change due to cultural changes in the attitude of yonger generations towards the future, policies changing the incentives to save (eg taxation of savings), … An interesting exercise therefore is to analyse the effect of a shock to these parameters on growth (of capital, output, labour productivity, consumption) both on the short-run and long-run equilibrium values (ie the steady state) of the economy. For example, we can ask what would be the effect of a permanent rise in \\(\\alpha\\), ie an increase in young households’ propensity to consume, and therefore a fall in their saving on labour productivity growth in the long-run and the short-run. The diagram below shows how the transition path schedule would shift down on impact as for a given level of the capital ratio and income per worker the level of saving falls, leading to an immediate fall in the capital stock on the next period. The economy would then converge to a lower steady state value of the capital-labour ratio. The model therefore predicts that a rise in \\(\\alpha\\) would lead to a fall in the labour productivity growth rate in the short-run, but not in the long-run as the capital ratio stabilises at a new steady state level eventually. However, the shock would have a permanent negative effect on the level of the capital-labour ratio and therefore on the level of productivity growth since \\(y_t\\downarrow = A(k_t\\downarrow)^\\beta\\). 3.7 Exercises with Copilot (Week 15) Although any large language model (LLM) can be used to do this exercise, we recommend using Microsoft Copilot for Edge browser, which is free of charge to all students through the University Microsoft license, to do these exercises. The notions of equilibrium and steady state are important concepts discussed in this chapter. This exercise helps you explore these two concepts further using Copilot. (Note that it may also be useful to check the notions of exogenous parameters and endogenous variables). Submit the following prompts to Microsoft Copilot and ask yourself the following in each case (if relevant): Does the answer address the question? What insight did you learn from this answer if any? Is there something inaccurate in the reasoning or that you do not understand? If yes, can you write a follow-up prompt to address it? Which element of the prompt improves the quality of the answer? Prompt 1: Explaining and comparing the concepts “Provide a clear, multiple paragraph explanation addressed to a second-year university student of the two concepts of equilibrium and the steady state in macroeconomic models such as the life-cycle growth model. First, explain each concept separately. Then explain the key differences between them.” Prompt 2: Exploring the relevance of a concept beyond Economics “Provide the name of three disciplines beyond Economics where the two concepts of equilibrium and steady state are commonly used.

Multiple choice questions should include plausible, competitive alternate responses and should not include an”all of the above option.” At the end of the quiz, you will provide an answer key and explain the right answer.” Attempt the test Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the question. Select the best three MCQs and propose them to one of your peers. Once you are confident you can answer all questions, ask for more difficult questions in a follow-up prompt (eg by adopting the persona of an researcher in academia). 3.8 Exercise: Model simulations (Week 15) This exercise guides you through the calculation of the equilibrium and steady state values of a model economy. It then asks you to perform some simple analyses of shocks to the model and produce model predictions that are easily comparable to real world observations (log plots and growth accounting results). In order to perform these practice questions, you will need to work on a laptop or a desktop computer (using a mouse), not a tablet. You also need to have installed Excel on your device (you may not be able to perform all the operations using the web version). Part 1: Preliminaries Read the chapter section above to refresh your memory of the life-cycle model. Download the “LIFE_CYCLE_MODEL_SIMULATION” Excel spreadsheet in the Week 15 class folder. Check that you understand what the parameters / variables in each column represent in the basic description of the model. Read Auerbach and Kotlikoff, Chapter 3, pp 62-64 (“Tracking the economy’s growth path”). The first part of this exercise asks you to replicate the simulation results discussed in this section. Part 2: Tracking the economy’s growth path To complete this part, go to “Part 2” sheet. In this part, we will assume \\(\\beta=0.3\\), \\(\\alpha=0.5\\), \\(A=10\\), \\(N=100\\) and \\(k_0=1.5\\). Input the values for the exogenous parameters of the model (\\(\\beta\\), \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\)) into the blue cells. Calculate the equilibrium value of \\(k_1\\) in cell F8. Calculate the equilibrium values of the capital-labour ratio \\(k\\) in all subsequent periods (Column F). Calculate the equilibrium values of the remaining variables of the model in period 1 and all subsequent periods (Columns G to Q). Calculate the (natural) logarithm of \\(k\\) and \\(y\\) in columns R and S and make a plot (only plot the first 10 periods). Calculate the growth rates of labour productivity and of the capital labour ratio (columns T and U). What happens to the levels and growth rates of the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity over time? On a piece of paper, draw a transition diagram to explain the time path of the capital-labour ratio in this simulation. Indicate on the diagram the initial and steady state values of \\(k\\) in this example. How does the life-cycle model explain the change in the growth rate of \\(k\\) over time in this example? In the growth accounting box (top), decompose the growth rate of labour productivity into the contribution of capital accumulation and the contribution of TFP growth between period 0 and period 10. How much of the growth in labour productivity is contributed by capital accumulation in this simulation? Part 3: Analysis of shocks To complete this part, go to “Part 3” sheet. In this part, we will analyse the effects of two exogenous shocks, one to a “capital accumulation” parameter (\\(\\alpha\\)) and one to the TFP parameter (\\(A\\)). In this part, we will assume that initially (period 0 to 10), \\(\\beta=0.3\\), \\(\\alpha=0.5\\), \\(A=10\\), \\(N=100\\) and \\(k_0=5.987\\). Input the values for the exogenous parameters of the model (\\(\\beta\\), \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\)) into the blue cells and calculate the values all the variables in periods 0 to 10. How would you characterise the state of the economy in this period? Assume that in period 10, the TFP parameter \\(A\\) increases permanently to 20 and all the other parameters remain the same. Input the new parameter values in the orange cells and calculate the values of all the variables between period 10 and 30. Calculate the (natural) logarithm of \\(k\\) and \\(y\\) in columns R and S and make a plot (only plot the first 10 periods). Calculate the growth rates of labour productivity and of the capital labour ratio (columns T and U). What happens to the levels and growth rates of the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity after period 10? On a piece of paper, draw a transition diagram to explain the time path of the capital-labour ratio in this simulation. Indicate on the diagram the initial and final steady state values of \\(k\\) in this example. How does the life-cycle model explain the change in the growth rates of \\(k\\) and \\(y\\) over time in this example? In the growth accounting box (top), decompose the growth rate of labour productivity into the contribution of capital accumulation and the contribution of TFP growth between period 10 and period 20. How much of the growth in labour productivity is contributed by capital accumulation and by TFP growth following this shock? Repeat the same analysis (create a new sheet) assuming that \\(\\alpha\\) increases permanently to \\(0.7\\) and all the other parameters remain the same.
