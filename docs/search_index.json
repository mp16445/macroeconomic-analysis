By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Calculate growth rates. Understand the role of compounding effects in modern growth trends and beyond.

We will use data from the Maddison Project Database 2023 (Bolt, Jutta and van Zanden, Jan Luiten 2024) and the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and P.Timmer 2015), allowing us to compare real economic outcomes over time and across countries. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in this chapter will always refer to real GDP. 1.1 Introduction Figure 1.1: Long-run trends in GDP per capita: 1700-2022 Figure 1.1 represents the evolution of GDP per capita over more than three centuries in today’s largest economies, where we measure the size of an economy by their total GDP. This data tells us of a story of growing global wealth (or standards of living) and inequality: Modern growth is a relatively recent phenomenon: GDP per capita was relatively constant in all countries until the late 18th century. It then started to increase exponentially in all countries at some point over the last 200 years. In most countries, this led to GDP per capita being multiplied by a factor of 10 or more. The great divergence: this exponential growth pattern started at different times in different countries. As a result, the difference between the richest and the poorest countries in this sample has grown from a factor of 4 to 5 in 1800 to a factor of 10 to 11 in 2018. There is also nothing to suggest that the countries lagging behind will eventually catch up to the most advanced economies. A variety of experiences: in most countries, the path has not been entirely smooth. The Russian Federation, Japan or South Africa experienced decades of stagnation or decline in the last 50 years. Similarly, some of the poorest countries, not represented here, have seen little to no growth as well as periods of prolonged decline over the same period. Growth rates and the dynamic performance of economies The dynamics of GDP over the long term observed in Figure 1.1 are the result of growth processes that are cumulative over time. Each year, an economy has the potential to build on the previous level of production to generate more output, which would allow for further increases in output in the following year, etc… In this view, the growth rate of output from one year to the next is a useful indicator of the dynamic performance of an economy. Irrespective of the size of the economy, it can also be used to compare the economic performance of different countries over the same period or the performance of a single economy over different periods. Economic theories of growth seek to understand the mechanisms that drive these changes in output and growth over time and the reasons why they may differ across countries. The power of compounding effects Two comparisons shed some light on the relationships between growth rates and changes in the levels of GDP in the long-run. Why do Americans have bigger fridges and cars than Britons? Between 1885 and 2022, GDP per capita in the United Kingdom increased from $6,132 to $38,407. Standards of living have therefore been multiplied by more than 6 in this country over this period. In contrast, GDP per capita in the United States over the same period has increased from $6,424 to $58,487, a nine-fold increase in standards of living. Starting from a similar level as that of the United Kingdom, GDP per capita in the United States has therefore grown at a faster rate and is now about 50% higher. How much higher than that of the United Kingdom must have been the annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States to arrive at this outcome? Why has GDP per capita in Nigeria not converge to that of the United Kingdom? GDP per capita in Nigeria has increased from $810 to $5,070 between 1885 and 2022. Therefore in both the United Kingdom and Nigeria, standards of living have been multiplied by slightly more than 6 over this period. As we will see, this means that they have grown at the same average annual growth rate. As a result, the two countries have not diverged but they have not converged either; the United Kingdom was and remains a bit more than 7.5 times richer than Nigeria. For GDP per capita in Nigeria to have converged to that of the United Kingdom over this period, how much higher should its annual growth rate have been on average? The answer to both questions is probably less than you would expect. Compounding effects explain why small differences in annual growth rates of GDP can have significant impacts on the levels of GDP in the long-run. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to reformulate these problems in mathematical terms and solve for the precise answer. You will also be equipped to produce informative graphical representations of growth trajectories (using logarithms) and use these techniques to extract some relevant facts about growth in countries across the world and over time. 1.2 Growth rates Most economic variables are observed at discrete time intervals. For example, to produce the plot in Figure 1.1, we used annual observations of GDP per capita (see Table 1.1). GDP is only observed at separate points in time. Time is discrete in the sense that it only takes on integer values, for example \\(t=2000, 2001, ..., 2004\\). 1.2.1 Definition The growth rate of \\(y\\) is the percentage change in \\(y\\) between time \\(t-1\\) and time \\(t\\): \\[g_t = \\frac{\\Delta y}{y} = \\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}-1\\] where \\(\\Delta y_t=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y}=y_t-y_{t-1}\\) is the change in variable \\(y\\) between \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\). In percentage terms: \\[\\%g_t=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \\times 100 \\] In Economics, growth rates are usually expressed in annual terms unless specified otherwise. Using the data in Table 1.1, the growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States between 2000 and 2001 is equal to: \\[\\% GDP_{2001}=\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2001}}{GDP_{2000}}-1\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{45878}{45886}-1\\right) \\times 100 = -0.01743\\%\\] Note that a growth rate can be negative. In this case, it simply means that the average value of goods and services produced per person in the United States declined between 2000 and 2001. Column 3 of Table 1.1 shows the annual growth rate of US GDP per capita over the full sample period (rounded to 2 decimal points). Table 1.1: The annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the US Year (t) GDP per capita (in $2011) Growth rate (%) 2000 45886 NA 2001 45878 -0.02 2002 46266 0.85 2003 47158 1.93 2004 48493 2.83 2005 49655 2.40 2006 50490 1.68 2007 50902 0.82 2008 50276 -1.23 2009 48453 -3.63 2010 49267 1.68 2011 49675 0.83 2012 50436 1.53 2013 51011 1.14 2014 51797 1.54 2015 52808 1.95 2016 53301 0.93 2017 54152 1.60 2018 55455 2.41 2019 56469 1.83 2020 54379 -3.70 2021 57523 5.78 2022 58487 1.68 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023. 1.2.2 Growth rates and logarithms An alternative formula using logarithms provides a useful approximation to the growth rate. Unless otherwise state, “logarithm” will refer to the “natural logarithm” in the chapter. Using the definition of the growth rate of variable \\(y\\), we have: \\[g_t = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}-1 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad 1+g_t = \\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}\\] Taking the logarithm on both sides and using the following property of logarithms \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}}= \\ln{a}-\\ln{b}\\): \\[\\ln{(1+g_t)} = \\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{t-1}} \\] For small values of \\(g_t\\), the approximation \\(\\ln{(1+g_t)} \\approx g_t\\) holds, leading to: The growth rate of variable \\(y\\) is well approximated by the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\) (for small \\(g\\)): \\[ g_t \\approx \\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\] where \\(\\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\) is the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\). Expressed in percentage terms: \\[ \\%g_t \\approx \\Delta\\ln{y_t} \\times 100\\] The equality would hold exactly if \\(y\\) were a continuous variable (see Appendix). Going back to the numerical example in the previous section: \\[\\% GDP_{2001} = (\\ln{GDP_{2001}} - \\ln{GDP_{2000}}) \\times 100 = (\\ln{45878} - \\ln{45886}) \\times 100 = -0.01744\\%\\] which is very close to the value calculated in the previous section. 1.3 Average growth rates The annual growth rates reported in Table 1.1 are mostly positive, suggesting that on average the economy grew on a consistent basis over the period observed. Can we summarise this growth experience over the long-run in a single number? 1.3.1 The trend growth path Figure 1.2 represents actual GDP per capita in the United States between 1870 and 2018 (black solid line) and an estimate of the trend in GDP per capita over the same period (dashed red line). Actual GDP per capita fluctuates around the trend line but both appear to be growing on average at the same rate over time. This average growth rate provides a clearer summary of long-run trends than the annual growth rates presented in Table 1.1. It abstracts from short-run fluctuations, which can be very large as in the case of the Great Depression in the 1930s, while still capturing the trajectory of GDP per capita in the long-run. Figure 1.2: GDP per capita in the United States: 1870-2023 How can we obtain an estimate of the annual growth rate of GDP per capita along this trend growth path? There are several valid methods to do so but there is at least one very incorrect one, which we discuss now. We might be tempted to calculate the average annual growth rate as the percentage change in GDP per capita between 1870 ($4,803) and 2018 ($55,335) divided by the number of years in between (148): \\[\\bar{g} =\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} -1 \\right)\\frac{1}{148}\\times 100= \\left(\\frac{55,335}{4,803}-1 \\right)\\frac{1}{148}\\times 100 = 7.11\\%\\] However, that would be wrong. Starting at $4,803 and assuming GDP per capita grows at an annual growth rate of 7.11% would lead to a level of GDP per capita 148 years later equal to $124,840,484, more than 2000 times the actual value of GDP per capita in 2018! 1.3.2 The compound growth rate The compound annual growth rate provides an estimate of the average growth rate which avoids falling into the same trap. Intuitively, it is the constant growth rate such that if GDP per capita had grown at this same rate every year, then starting at $4,803 in 1870, GDP per capita 148 years later would be exactly equal to $55,335. Assume that GDP per capita grows at the same rate \\(\\bar{g}\\) every year. Using the growth rate formula, \\(\\bar{g} = \\frac{GDP_{1871}}{GDP_{1870}}-1\\): \\[GDP_{1871}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}\\] and \\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1871}\\] Substituting the first expression into the second gives: \\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\\bar{g})^{2}GDP_{1870}\\] and \\[GDP_{1873}=(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1872}=(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})(1+\\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\\bar{g})^{3}GDP_{1870}\\] By repeated substitution: \\[GDP_{2018}=(1+\\bar{g})^{148}GDP_{1870}\\] Definition: Compound growth Growth derived from growth achieved in previous periods. Intuition: each year, the growth rate applies to the initial level of GDP as well as to the accumulated growth from previous years. In other words, each year’s growth generates further growth in subsequent years. Such compounding effects explain how an economy growing at a relatively small annual rate may nevertheless experience the exponential increase observed in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. Solving for \\(\\bar{g}\\): \\[(1+\\bar{g})^{148}=\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad 1+\\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}\\] \\[\\bar{g}=\\left(\\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}-1 =\\left(\\frac{55,335}{4,803} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{148}}-1=0.01665 \\] or \\(\\bar{g} = 1.67\\%\\). The reason why the incorrect method discussed above led to an incorrect estimate of the average growth rate is because it ignored the presence of these compounding effects, leading it to overestimate the trend annual growth rate. Definition: Compound growth rate Let \\(y\\) be any trending variable (GDP, population, …) following an exponential pattern over time, its initial value at time \\(0\\) be \\(y_0\\) and its trend growth rate be \\(\\bar{g}\\). \\[ y_t = (1+\\bar{g})^{t} y_0 \\] Compound annual growth rate formula: \\[ \\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{y_t}{y_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \\] See Appendix 2 for derivation of results in this section. 1.3.3 The logarithm approximation As for the growth rate, there exists an approximation of this formula, which makes use of logarithms: Taking the logarithm on both sides and using the following properties of logarithms \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}}= \\ln{a}-\\ln{b}\\) and \\(\\ln{a^b} = b\\ln{a}\\): \\[\\ln{(1+\\bar{g})} = \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{0}}) \\] For small values of \\(g_t\\), the approximation \\(\\ln{(1+\\bar{g})} \\approx \\bar{g}\\) holds, leading to: \\[ \\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{0}})\\] Applying this formula to the previous example: \\[ \\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{148}(\\ln{GDP_{2018}} - \\ln{GDP_{1870}}) = \\frac{1}{148}(\\ln{55,335} - \\ln{4,803}) = 0.01651 \\] or \\(\\bar{g} = 1.65\\%\\), which close to the average growth rate calculated in the previous section, but not quite. 1.3.4 A note of caution It is easy to compute the average growth rate over any given interval of time by just plugging in values into the compound annual growth rate formula. But the compound growth rate may be misleading or uninformative as a summary statistic of long-run trends when the growth rate fluctuates widely over time. There may be decades where the growth rate is small (and even negative), followed or preceded by decades where the growth rate is high. It is important to do a preliminary inspection of the data to check that you are fitting the appropriate model to your data. For example, GDP per capita in Haiti has experienced wide swings between 1945 and 2023 as illustrated in Figure 1.3, with decades of growth (1965-1980, 1995-2015) followed by decades of decline (1955-1965, 1980-1995). The full sample period average growth rate would be relatively uninformative about this economy’s growth dynamics. Figure 1.3: GDP per capita in Haiti: 1945-2023 1.4 Logarithm plots and ratio scales Plots of GDP on a logarithmic or ratio scale feature frequently in the economic press. A few examples can be found here and here. In this section, we explain why these plots are useful representations of GDP trends and how to interpret them. 1.4.1 Logarithm plots We saw that the change in the logarithm of a variable provides a good approximation to the growth rate of this variable provided it is small enough. This suggests that growth rates can be read off the plot of the logarithm of a variable \\(y\\) against time, where the slope at any point in time is the change in the logarithm of \\(y\\) (\\(\\Delta\\ln{y_t}\\)). The left panel of Figure 1.4 plots a variable \\(y\\) which grows over time at a constant growth rate \\(g\\) according to the following function: \\(y_t = (1+g)^t y_0\\). We set \\(y_0=1\\) and \\(g=0.05\\), so \\(y\\) grows at the rate of 5% in each period starting at an initial value of 1. Figure 1.4: Plots of a variable growing at a constant rate The right panel of Figure 1.4 plots the natural logarithm of \\(y\\) allowing us to see immediately that \\(y\\) grows at a constant rate (the straight line has constant slope). This follows from the fact that the logarithm of \\(y\\) is a linear function of time: \\[y_t = (1+g)^t y_0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\ln{y_t}=\\ln{(1+g)}\\times t+\\ln{y_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\ln{y_t} \\approx g\\times t+\\ln{y_0}\\] using \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\). It is easy to verify that the slope of the logarithm plot (\\(\\Delta\\ln{y}/\\Delta t = \\Delta\\ln{y}/1\\)) is equal to 0.05, the growth rate of \\(y\\). Figure 1.5: Plots of three variables growing at a constant rate Figure 1.5 plots \\(y\\) and its logarithm for three different value of the constant growth rate \\(g\\). The exponential gap in the path of the three series illustrates the compounding effect of growth. A small difference in growth rates can generate large differences in the level of variables in the long-run. Example: GDP per capita in the United States (1870-2023) Going back to US real GDP per capita, we already noticed the exponential pattern of GDP per capita over the last two centuries. Focusing on the period 1870-2018, we can now check graphically whether the US economy grew at a relatively constant average growth rate over this period. If the growth rate is constant over time we would expect the plot of its logarithm to be well approximated by a straight line. Figure 1.6: (Level and logarithm of) GDP per capita in the United States: 1870-2023 The middle panel in Figure 1.6 represents the logarithm of US real GDP per capita. Although not perfect, the plot does appear to be approximately linear, suggesting a relatively constant growth rate over the long-run. This hypothesis can be further evaluated by fitting a line of best fit (in blue) to the plot of the logarithm (right panel) and checking how well the line fits the data. The estimate of the slope of the line of best fit is 0.0167, which corresponds to a growth rate of 1.67% per year and is similar to the compound growth rate calculated in the previous section. 1.4.2 Logarithmic (ratio) scales We have seen how the slope of the plot of the logarithm of the trending variable \\(y\\) allows us to evaluate quickly the growth rate of \\(y\\). We now turn to what it means to plot the logarithm of a variable, ie to represent a variable on a logarithmic (or ratio) scale. The left and middle panels of Figure 1.7 represent the same variable \\(y\\) growing at a rate of 5% per period and its natural logarithm \\(\\ln{y}\\) once again. The natural logarithm of \\(y\\), is the number of times Euler’s number \\(e=2.72...\\) needs to be multiplied by itself in order to obtain \\(y\\). The plots shows that when \\(y\\) is equal to 150, its natural logarithm is approximately equal to 5. So 5 is the natural logarithm of 150, or the number of times \\(e\\) needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain the number 150 (to be exact, 5 is the natural logarithm of \\(e^5=148.4132\\)). Figure 1.7: Representing variables on a logarithmic scale This gives us an alternative interpretation of the logarithm plot: every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by \\(e\\). So when at time \\(t=40\\) we read off the plot that \\(lny=2\\), this means that \\(y\\) is approximately equal to \\(e^2=7.389\\). Similarly, \\(lny=3\\) at time \\(t=60\\) means that \\(y\\) is approximately equal to \\(e^3=20.086\\). This is the intuition behind the logarithmic scale (also called log scale or ratio scale) represented on the right panel, which is constructed by relabeling the value of the natural logarithm of \\(lny\\) on the vertical axis with the corresponding value of \\(y\\). Changing the base number of the logarithm allows us to set more intuitive multiplying factors. For example, the logarithm base 2 of \\(y\\), represents the number of times the number 2 needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain \\(y\\). So on a plot of the logarithm base 2 of \\(y\\) (right panel of Figure 1.8), every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by 2. This plot can be used to read graphically on the horizontal axis how long it takes for variable \\(y\\) to double. Figure 1.8: Representing variables on a logarithmic scale (base 2) We can see that it takes slightly less than fifteen periods for \\(y\\), which is still growing at the rate of 5% per period, to double. So it would take slightly less than fifteen years for the GDP per capita of an economy that is growing at the rate of 5% per year to double. This may seem surprising but is a direct consequence of the compounding effects discussed before. Note: if the variable grows at a constant rate, the slope of the plot of of the logarithm base 2 (different from the natural logarithm) is constant, but it is not equal to the growth. 1.4.3 Rule of 70 Assuming a variable \\(y\\) grows at a comppund average growth rate \\(g\\), how many years \\(t\\) does it take for it to double in value? We just saw how plotting a variable using a log scale allows us to see immediately how long it would take for a variable to double (or triple, quadruple, etc…). It is also possible to address this question numerically using a useful result known as the rule of 70. Rule of 70: if a variable \\(y\\) grows at the rate of \\(\\%g\\) per period, then it takes approximately \\(t \\approx \\frac{70}{\\%g}\\) periods for the value of \\(y\\) to double. Proof: let \\(y_t\\) be such that it is twice the initial income per capita level \\(y_0\\) and \\(t\\) be the number of periods it takes for income per capita to double. Using \\(y_t = (1+g)^{t} y_0\\): \\[y_t = (1+g)^ty_0 = 2 \\times y_0 \\quad \\rightarrow 2 = (1+g)^t \\] Taking logs on both sides: \\[ \\ln{2} = t \\times \\ln{(1+g)}\\] Using the fact that \\(\\ln{2} \\approx 0.7\\) and \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\) (for small values of g): \\[t = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{\\ln{(1+g)}} \\approx \\frac{0.7}{g} = \\frac{70}{\\%g}\\] So when \\(y\\) grows at rate \\(g=0.05\\) in each period as in our example, the formula predicts that it would take approximately \\(\\frac{70}{5}=14\\) periods for it to double, in line with what we observed in Figure 1.8. Example: GDP per capita in the United States (1870-2022) Figure 1.9: GDP per capita in the United States (in 2011$): normal and logarithmic scale Figure 1.9 illustrates how this tool can be used to analyse the behaviour of GDP per capita over time. The right panel shows that it took slightly more than 35 years for GDP per capita to double in the United States, consistent with the prediction of the rule of 70 that when GDP per capita is growing at the trend rate of 1.67%, it will take about 42 years to double. 1.5 Growth in the United Kingdom and the United States Figure 1.10: GDP per capita in the United States and United Kingdom: 1800-2022 Figure 1.10 suggests that on average GDP per capita in the United States grew faster than in the United Kingdom over the last 200 years. However, some questions are less easily answered just by looking at this plot. First, was the growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States and the United Kingdom constant over time or were there periods of faster (slower) growth? Second, was GDP per capita in the United States always growing at a faster rate than in the United Kingdom over these two centuries or only during specific periods? We can address these questions using the techniques developed in the previous sections. Figure 1.11 plots the logarithm of GDP per capita for both countries and can be used to identify subperiods. Table 1.2 presents estimates of the trend growth rates of GDP per capita for both the United States and the United Kingdom for the full sample period and four subperiods. Figure 1.11: United States vs United Kingdom: GDP per capita (1800-2022) Table 1.2: UK and US: Average growth rates over different subperiods Period United states United Kingdom 1800-2022 1.42 1.11 1800-1830 0.59 0.20 1830-1946 1.38 0.96 1946-2022 1.82 1.69 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023. Compound average annual growth rates (%). Did the two economies grow at a constant rate over the last two centuries or were there periods of faster or slower growth? Growth accelerated in both countries after 1830. Although the United States grew at a relatively constant rate between 1830 and 2022 (between 1.4% and 1.8%), the growth experience of the United Kingdom is relatively more uneven. Its GDP per capita grew significantly faster on average in the second part of the 20th century (1.7%) compared to the previous period (1%). Can we identify periods when GDP per capita in the United States grew at a substantially faster rate than that of the United Kingdom? GDP per capita grew at relatively similar rates in the two countries between 1946 and 2022, which can be seen both in the log plot and the estimated average gowth rates. However, between 1830 and 1946, GDP per capita grew at a substantially higher average growth rate in the United States, which is the period when US GDP per capita overtook UK GDP per capita. In this period, the average growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States is 0.4 percentage point higher than that of the United Kingdom between 1830 and 1946. This relatively small difference on an annual basis explains why, by the end of this period, US GDP per capita was almost 50% higher than that of the UK, having started at a lower level (See Figure 1.10). Summary The growth rate of variable \\(y\\) is defined as the percentage change of \\(y\\) between any two consecutive periods \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\\%g_t=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \\times 100 \\] When a variable follows an exponential growth pattern, the compound annual growth rate provides a useful measure of the average growth rate over an interval of time. It is calculated as: \\[ \\bar{g} = \\left(\\frac{y_t}{y_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \\] where \\(\\bar{g}\\) is the average growth rate and \\(y_0\\) is the initial value of \\(y\\). Compounding effect of growth: growth in each period derives from growth achieved in the previous period. This explains why relatively small differences in annual growth rates between countries may lead to large differences in the level of macroeconomic variables in the long-run. Two useful approximations (provided growth rates are small) of these growth rates are based on transformations using logarithms: \\(g_t \\approx \\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_{t-1}}\\) and \\(\\bar{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{t}(\\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_0})\\) Plots of logarithms are particularly well suited to describe growth trends: The slope of the plot of the logarithm of a variable provides a good approximation of the growth rate of this series at any point in time. The plot of the logarithm of a variable represents how many times this variable is multiplied by a given factor (\\(e\\) in the case of the natural logarithm) over a certain interval of time. The rule of 70 states states that it takes approximately \\(70 / \\%g\\) periods for a variable growing at rate \\(\\%g\\) to double.

In which period did GDP per capita in Indonesia grow at the slowest pace? Question 8 Source: Maddison Project Database 2023 The figure above represents GDP per capita in Indonesia on a ratio scale. Based on this figure, how many years did it take approximately for GDP per capita to double in Indonesia over this period? Using your answer in a., provide an approximation for the average annual growth rate using the rule of 70. Question 9 The rule of 70 gives the number of years it would take for a variable to double given their annual growth rate. But we could derive similar formulas to calculate the number of years it would take for a variable to triple, quadruple, …, given their average annual growth rate. Derive an expression for the number of years it would take for a variable to be multiplied by 6 given an annual growth rate \\(\\%g\\). Hint: use the following approximation \\(\\ln{(1+g)} \\approx g\\) (for small g). In the introduction we saw that GDP per capita in the UK and Nigeria have been multiplied by about 6 between 1885 and 2022. Using the expression derived in a., find an estimate of the average annual growth rate in the two countries over this period. Appendix 1: Continuous time notation Discrete versus continuous time change In this chapter, we have not made much use of the continuous time notation, preferring to describe the behaviour of variables in discrete time. This reflects the fact that most macroeconomic variables are observed in discrete time. In the discrete time perspective, variables remain unchanged during the interval between two time periods. In the continuous time perspective, variables remain unchanged for an infinitesimally short amount of time. This leads to different ways of expressing the change in these variables. For a more precise definition of these two concepts see here. The continuous time change in variable \\(y\\) at \\(t\\) is the instantaneous change in \\(y\\) at time \\(t\\). It is defined as the change in variable \\(y\\) between two time periods as the interval of time between these two time periods tends to 0. In other terms, it is the derivative of the variable \\(y\\) with respect to time, denoted \\(\\dot{y}_t\\) and defined as: \\[\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}=\\frac{y_t-y_{t-\\Delta t}}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\dot{y}_t\\] In this course, we will formulate economic models using the discrete time notation. The continuous time notation presents analytical advantages and for this reason is often employed in growth models and in textbooks. Continuous time growth rate The continuous time counterpart to the growth rate formula described above is the instantaneous growth rate or proportional change. The instantaneous growth rate of variable \\(x\\) at time \\(t\\) is calculated as the ratio of the instantaneous change in \\(x\\) and its initial value: \\[g_{t}=\\frac{\\dot{x}_t}{x_t} \\] Compounding growth rate Assume a variable \\(y\\) (GDP, population, …) has initial value \\(y_0\\) and grows at the constant rate \\(g\\). Continuous compounding corresponds to the case where the frequency of compounding (\\(n\\) times a year) becomes infinitely large. Assuming continuous compounding, after \\(t\\) periods its value is equal to: \\[ y_t = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{g}{n}\\right)^{nt} = e^{gt} y_0\\] where \\(e = 271828...\\) is Euler’s number. By taking the logarithm of this expression and rearranging, we obtain the following formula for the constant continuous time trend growth rate: \\[ g = \\frac{1}{t}\\times(\\ln{y_t}-\\ln{y_0})\\] Growth rate and logarithm Assume a variable \\(y\\) has initial value \\(y_0\\) and grows at the continuously compounded constant rate \\(g\\), ie it follows this process: \\(y_t = e^{gt} y_0\\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the continuous compounding expression and using the rules of logarithms: \\[\\ln{y_t}=\\ln{e^{gt}}+\\ln{y_0}=g\\times t + \\ln{y_0} = C + g \\times t\\] Where \\(C=\\ln{y_0}\\) (constant). This expression tells us that the logarithm of variable \\(y\\) can be expressed as a linear function of time \\(t\\). This implies that if a variable is growing at a constant rate, then the plot of its logarithm against time is a straight line. Moreover, the slope of this plot represents the (continuous time) growth rate of this variable.

We will use data from the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and P.Timmer 2015), which allow us to compare real economic outcomes over time and across countries. All macroeconomic outcomes described, such as GDP, and capital stock, are real outcomes although this may not be explicitly mentioned for simplicity in the text. 2.1 Introduction The starting point of growth theory is the assumption that there are three main proximate causes of long-term growth in output: technological progress, the accumulation of capital and improvements in the size and skills of the labour force. Growth theories attempt to understand the forces that drive these factors over time as well as their interactions by making assumptions regarding the behaviour of households and firms. In this chapter, we will present the growth accounting methodology, which is a method developed by economists to quantify the relative importance of these factors, and apply it to the case of labour productivity growth in South Korea. (#fig:plot1 )Figure 1: South Korea: 1953-2019 Figure 1 shows that the strong growth in output per worker that occurred in South Korea between the 1960s and 1990s was also associated with a strong growth in the capital-labour ratio. This raises the following questions: What has been the role of capital accumulation in the growth of labour productivity in South Korea over this period? Was capital accumulation the main determinant of labour productivity growth or were there other factors that played more important roles? The neoclassical production function states that output per hour can increase either if the capital-labour ratio (or capital per hour) increases or if total factor productivity (TFP) increases. The capital-labour ratio captures the intensity with which capital is employed in production. It is a better measure of the importance of capital accumulation than the capital stock, which would also be expected to increase with population. An increase in the capital-labour ratio implies that the capital stock is growing at a faster rate than the labour input. Total factor productivity includes any factor that improves the efficiency of the economy at combining capital and labour in order to produce total output. An increase in total factor productivity may consist in technological innovations such as the diffusion of software packages which dramatically decreased the time spent performing some administrative tasks or computations, or in the implementation of better management techniques, or a reallocation of capital and skills in more productive sectors or the most productive firms within a sector, etc… Growth accounting can be used to provide a rough description of the growth of output per hour over a given interval of time in terms of the relative contribution of capital accumulation and total factor productivity growth. This method allowed R. Solow (1956) to assign close to 88% of the growth in output per hour in the US in the first part of the 20th century to TFP growth and the remaining 12% to capital accumulation. Since then economists have refined the methodology to allow for more precise estimates using more precise decompositions taking into account the role played by different types of capital and the different skill levels of the workforce in different sectors. The major role assigned to TFP growth in developed economies remains the key result obtained through this type of exercise. Another important contribution of growth accounting is to provide one method to estimate total factor productivity growth, a factor that is difficult to observe or measure, and even still difficult to explain. Although growth accounting can yield some powerful insights, its ability to describe accurately the underlying economic mechanisms depends on strong assumptions, the failure of which may cast doubt on the conclusions that can be drawn from these calculations. In the next sections, we will explain how we arrive at the growth accounting decomposition and illustrate the use of this methodology by examining the case of labour productivity growth in South Korea between 1953 and 2019. 2.2 Growth accounting equation In order to structure our investigation of the relative contributions of the factor inputs to the growth of output, we need to use a theoretical framework to organise our thoughts. Whether the results of a growth accounting provides a good picture of the growth experience of a country over a given period depends on how good an approximation these assumptions are for the economy in question at the moment of time considered. 2.2.1 Derivation Assumption 1: Cobb-Douglas production function \\[Y_t=A_tK_t^\\beta L_t^{1-\\beta}\\] where \\(Y_t\\) is Real GDP, \\(K_t\\) is the capital stock (structures, transport and communication equipment, computers, software, machinery, …), \\(L_t\\) is the quantity of labour input (measured in number of workers, number of hours worked, hours worked adjusted for labour quality, …) and \\(A_t\\) is the stock of technology (may capture technological progress, the allocation of resources in the economy, the organisation of labour and management practices, …). Note that all variables are a function of time (they have a time subscript \\(t\\)). \\(\\beta\\) is the elasticity of output with respect to capital and assumed to be constant and \\(0&lt;\\beta&lt;1\\). The Cobb-Douglas production function exhibits constant returns to scale and diminishing returns to both capital and labour. It also embodies the idea of a complementarity between capital and labour in production: more of each input, holding the other constant, increases the productivity of the other input. Since we are interested in the growth of labour productivity (or output per worker), which is more informative about living standards than total output, we rewrite the Cobb-Douglas production function in intensive form as: \\[y_t=A_tk_t^\\beta \\] where \\(y\\) is output per hour (labour productivity) and \\(k\\) is the capital-labour ratio. We are interested in growth rates. How can we express the relationship between the growth rate of labour productivity (\\(g_y\\)) and the growth rates of the capital-labour ratio (\\(g_k\\)) and total factor productivity growth (\\(g_A\\)) implied by this production function? By taking the logs. Taking the logarithm on both sides of the production function: \\[\\ln{y_t} = ln{A_t} + \\beta \\ln{k_t}\\] where we use the following properties of logarithms: \\(\\ln{ab} = \\ln{a} + \\ln{b}\\) and \\(\\ln{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\ln{a} - \\ln{b}\\). Subtracting \\(\\ln{y_{t-1}} = ln{A_{t-1}} + \\beta \\ln{k_{t-1}}\\) from the previous expression yields: \\[\\ln{y_t} - \\ln{y_{t-1}}= ln{A_t} - ln{A_{t-1}} + \\beta (\\ln{k_t} - \\ln{k_{t-1}})\\] Using the approximation \\(g_{x,t} \\approx \\ln{x_t} - \\ln{x_{t-1}}\\) which holds for small values of \\(g_{x,t}\\) (see Chapter 1): \\[g_{y,t}= g_{A,t} + \\beta g_{k,t}\\] where \\(\\beta g_{k,t}\\) is the contribution of capital accumulation and \\(g_{A,t}\\) is the contribution of TFP growth to labour productivity growth. 2.2.2 Estimation National accounts provide data on GDP, labour and capital from which we can easily recover estimates for \\(g_y\\) and \\(g_k\\). To obtain estimates of the elasticity of capita \\(\\beta\\), several options are possible: Set it equal to 0.3 as a rule of thumb. Recent studies (Vollrath, 2024) have shown that for the United States, this elasticity has been relatively constant around 0.2-0.3. To obtain such estimates, the authors of these studies do not rely on the assumption of perfect competition in the product markets but still need to make additional assumptions, such that firms choose the quantity of inputs that are cost minimising. This elasticity may be expected to be relatively similar in other developed economies. However, they may differ significantly in developing economies. Use data on the labour share of income, provided in National accounts, from which it is possible to recover an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) as (\\(1 - \\text{labour share of income}\\)). This relies on the assumption that markets are perfectly competitive, hence firms make zero profits, the wage and rental rate of capital are equal to their marginal products and, assuming constant returns to scale, total income is equal to the sum of the income distributed to labour and capital as a reward for their services. If product markets are not competitive so that firms have the ability to set the price of their final products, then this method will tend to overestimate the elasticity of capital. The default value of \\(\\beta\\) in all the examples will be 0.3. But it will be possible to experiment with different values of \\(\\beta\\) to check the robustness of results. Finally, total factor productivity growth is not directly observed but can be estimated as the residual of the growth accounting equation: \\[ g_{A,t}= g_{y,t} - \\beta g_{k,t} \\] 2.3 Case study: South Korea (1953-2019) The table and chart below present the same growth accounting results for South Korea over the period 1953-2019 in two different ways. Growth rates are compound annual growth rates. Interpretation and discussion Labour productivity over the full sample period grew at the average annual rate of 4.7%; this is faster than the growth in US labour productivity. This is indicating that the economy of South Korea was converging towards the US level of labour productivity. South Korea experienced a period of fast growth growing at an average rate of about 6% per year for about 50 years between the 1960s and 2000s. Its growth has since more than halved to less than 3%, similarly to other developed economies. The growth of capital per hour contributed 1.4% towards the growth of labour productivity and TFP growth contributed the remaining 3.3%. TFP growth was therefore the main factor of growth over the full sample period, contributing about 70% of the growth in labour productivity and capital accumulation the remaining 30%. These shares remained remarkably constant over all subperiods. These results suggest that the key to understanding the growth experience of South Korea is to look into the drivers of TFP growth. In particular, it might be interesting to disentangle the role of human capital accumulation (education, on-the-job-training, …) from other factors of total factor productivity growth. This would allow us to determine how much weight was given in the growth strategy to the accumulation of factors of production as opposed to increases in efficiency. This could provide some clue as to the recent slowdown in TFP growth.

An integrated approach, 2nd Ed., The MIT Press: Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 3. 3.2 Model setup 3.2.1 The markets for goods, capital and labour Assume an economy where a single output good is produced by firms. Households purchase this good in the good market and decide either to consume it or to save it, in which case it becomes instantaneously a capital/investment good. This output good is also the unit of measurement in this economy, so its price is normalised to one (\\(P=1\\)) and all the other prices (wage and interest rate) are expressed in units of output good. Firms produce the output good using two factor inputs: capital and labour. The price of renting the capital stock is the interest rate (or rental rate) \\(r\\) and the price of hiring labour is the wage \\(w\\). Firms hire labour and capital from households in the market for capital and labour. We assume that the markets for capital and labour are perfectly competitive so that both firms and households take the wage and the interest rate as given when making their labour and capital demand and supply decisions. In other words, individual firms and households do not have the power to affect these prices. Such a situation may arise because there are infinitely many firms and households competing for jobs and workers or because of free market entry. 3.2.2 Production technology The aggregate production function is assumed to take the form of the Cobb-Douglas production function: \\[ Y_t =A K_t^{\\beta}L_t^{1-\\beta} \\quad [\\text{Total output}]\\] where \\(Y_t\\) is total output, \\(K_t\\) is the total capital stock, \\(L\\) is the total amount of labour input (number of workers or hours) \\(A\\) is total factor productivity (or multifactor productivity) and \\(\\beta\\) is the elasticity of output with respect to capital (the elasticity of output with respect to labour is \\(1-\\beta\\)). This production function exhibits two important properties: Property 1: Constant returns to scale: Increasing both capital and labour by the same percentage leads to an equal percentage change in output. \\[ A(\\lambda K_t)^\\beta(\\lambda L_t)^{1-\\beta}= \\lambda A K_t^{\\beta}L_t^{1-\\beta} \\] Property 2: Diminishing returns to capital and labour: \\[MPK= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{L_t}{K_t}\\right)^{1-\\beta} \\] The marginal product of capital is the amount by which total output increases when the capital stock increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of labour input. It is decreasing with the size of the capital stock and increasing with the amount of labour input. In other words, the higher the level of the capital stock, the lower its return and the higher the labour input the higher the marginal productivity of capital. \\[MPL= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L} = (1-\\beta) \\left(\\frac{K_t}{L_t}\\right)^{\\beta} \\] The marginal product of labour is the amount by which total output increases when the labour input increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of capital. It is decreasing with the ampunt of labour input used and increasing with the level of the capital stock. In other words, the more labour is used in production, the lower its return and the higher the capital stock, the higher the marginal productivity of labour. Because our focus will be on labour productivity, we will expressed the Cobb-Douglas production function in intensive form: \\[ y_t =A k_t^{\\beta} \\quad [\\text{Labour productivity}]\\] where \\(y = \\frac{Y}{L}\\) is labour productivity (output per worker/hour) and \\(k= \\frac{K}{L}\\) is the capital-labour ratio (the amount of capital per unit of labour used). 3.3 Firms’ demand for capital and labour In each periods, firms choose the amount of capital and labour employed that maximises their profits, taking as given \\(\\bar{w}_t\\) and \\(\\bar{r}_t\\) (perfectly competitive markets). Firms’ profit maximisation problem: \\[\\max_{L,K} \\pi = PY_t - \\bar{w}_tL_t-\\bar{r}_tK_t\\] where \\(Py=Y\\) is total revenue, \\(\\bar{w}L\\) is total labour costs and \\(\\bar{r}K\\) is total capital costs, Firms’ optimal demand for capital and labour satisfy the condition that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost: \\(MR = MC\\) Firms’ demand for capital: \\[MPK= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K} =\\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} = \\bar{r}_t\\] Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of capital is just equal to the market interest rate. Assuming the interest rate is equal to \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), the optimal demand for capital is given by \\(K_2\\). To see why any other amount of capital stock would not be optimal, let’s consider two cases: A higher capital stock would imply a lower marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), so firms would be making a loss. Firms would be able to reduce their loss by reducing their capital stock. A lower capital stock would imply a higher marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate \\(\\bar{r}_2\\), so firms would be making a positive profit. Firms would be able to increase their profit by increasing their capital stock by a marginal amount. Firms’ demand for labour: \\[MPL= \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L} = (1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} = \\bar{w}_t \\] Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of labour is just equal to the market wage. Assuming the wgae is equal to \\(\\bar{w}_2\\), the optimal demand for labour is given by \\(L_2\\). Following the same reasoning as for capital, it is possible to show that any other amount of labour would not be optimal. 3.4 Households’ supply for capital and labour 3.4.1 Setup We assume that households live for 2 periods (about 30 years each), so at any point in time they are either “young” or “old”. Households who are young in one period become old in the second period, while a new generation of young households arrives. The diagram below shows how the generations overlap over time. We further assume that there is no population growth, and at any point in time there are \\(N\\) members of the young generation and \\(N\\) members of the old generation. “Young” households start life with zero assets, work full-time and earn labour income \\(w\\). At the end of the first period they decide how much of their income to consume, and how much to save. When they save they accumulate the assets that they will hold at the beginning of the net period. More formally, “young” households supply labour, \\(N\\), earn the market wage \\(\\bar{w}\\), consume \\(c_{y,t}\\) and accumulate assets \\(a_{t+1}\\). This gives us the total supply of labour in the economy: \\[N \\quad [\\text{Labour supply}]\\] “Old” households do not work (they are retired). At the beginning of the period, they invest their assets in their own firms, employ young households to produce output, pay young households wage payments and keep the rest as capital income. At the end of the period they consume all their assets and capital income and end life with zero assets. More formally, “old” households, invest their assets \\(a_{t+1}\\) as capital and earn capital income \\(\\bar{r}_{t+1}a_{t+1}\\) and consume all their capital and income at the end of the period, \\(c_{o,t+1}\\). This gives us the total supply of capital in the economy as the sum of all the assets accumulated by the old generation at the end of the previous period: \\[K_{t+1} = Na_{t+1} \\quad [\\text{Capital supply}]\\] 3.4.2 Households’ problem Because there is no uncertainty in the model, households decide on their consumption levels for both periods of their lives at the beginning of their lifetime. More precisely, households’ choices of how much to consume when young and when old maximise their lifetime utility subject to their intertemporal budget constraint. 3.4.3 The intertemporal budget constraint Young households’ budget constraint: \\[ c_{y,t} + a_{t+1} = w_t\\] Old households’ budget constraint: \\[c_{o,t+1}= (1+r_{t+1})a_{t+1} \\quad [\\text{Old household consumption}]\\] Combining the two, we obtain the intertemporal budget constraint: \\[ c_{y,t} + \\frac{c_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}= w_t \\] which states that the present value of consumption when young and old (left-hand side) should be equal to the present value of lifetime income (right-hand side), where \\(\\frac{1}{1+r_{t+1}}\\) is the price of consumption when old at the beginning of life. The intertemporal budget constraint represents the set of combinations of consumption when young and when old that are achievable, for given \\(w\\) and \\(r\\). The diagram makes it clear that the rate at which consumption when young can be traded for consumption when old is \\(1+r_{t+1}\\). 3.4.4 Lifetime utility Households preferences for consumption over their lifetime takes the form of a Cobb-Douglas utility function: \\[u_t = c_{y,t}^{\\alpha} c_{o,t+1}^{1-\\alpha} \\] where \\(u_t\\) is the lifetime utility of a typical member of the generation born at time \\(t\\) and \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\) is the key preference parameter, assumed to be constant and capturing how much households value consumption when young relative to consumption when old. Lifetime utility is also a measure of the welfare of each generation, which depends only on their consumption levels in both periods here. Important properties of this utility function: Utility is increasing in both consumption when young and consumption when old. Diminishing marginal utility of consumption: as seen on the diagram, the marginal rate of substitution between \\(c_{y,t}\\) and \\(c_{o,t+1}\\), ie the rate at which households would be willing to substitute consumption when young for consumption when old is decreasing. 3.4.5 Optimal consumption and saving decision Households’ optimal consumption choices satisfies: \\[ MRS = -\\frac{MU{cy,t}}{MU{co,t+1}} = - (1+r_{t+1}) \\quad [\\text{Tangency condition}]\\] \\[ c_{y,t} + \\frac{c_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}= w_t \\quad [\\text{Intertemporal budget constraint}]\\] Solving for \\(c_{y,t}\\) and \\(a_{t+1}\\) yields: \\[c_{y,t} = \\alpha w_t \\quad [\\text{Young household consumption}]\\] \\[a_{t+1}= (1- \\alpha) w_t \\quad [\\text{Young household saving = Assets when old}]\\] 3.4.6 Saving and investment So far we have solved for the saving of “young” households separately. We turn now to the measure of national saving. Saving of the “young” households at time \\(t\\): \\[ S_{y,t} = Na_{t+1} \\] Saving of the “old” households at time \\(t\\): \\[ S_{o,t} = r_tNa_t - N(1+r_t)a_t = - Na_t \\] where the first term (\\(r_tNa_t\\)) is total capital income earned by all the members of the “old” generation at time \\(t\\) and the second term (\\(N(1+r_t)a_t\\)) is the total consumption by the members of the “old” generation at time \\(t\\). National saving (\\(S_t\\)) is equal to the sum of the saving of the young and old households at any given point in time: \\[S_t = S_{y,t} + S_{o,t} = Na_{t+1} - Na_t = K_{t+1} - K_t = I_t\\] where investment (\\(I_t\\)) is equal to the change in the capital stock between the current period and the next (\\(K_{t+1} - K_t\\)) assuming capital does not depreciates. At any point in time, national investment is equal to national saving. Given that output must be equal to the sum of consumption and investment (\\(Y_t=C_t+I_t\\)), this is equivalent to saying that the good market is in equilibrium. 3.5 Equilibrium Having discussed the supply and demand sides of the economy, we are now in a position to solve for the equilibrium values of the key variables of our model, labour productivity, the capital-labour ratio, the wage, the interest and consumption when young and when old. 3.5.1 Equilibrium in the market for capital and labour Equilibrium in the labour and capital markets is achieved when demand is equal to supply. The demand for labour is decreasing in the wage whereas the supply of labour is fixed (\\(N\\)) and independent of the wage. Therefore, equilibrium labour input (\\(L_t\\)) is equal to the fixed labour supply: \\[L_t = N \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium labour}]\\] and the equilibrium wage is equal to the marginal product of labour at this equilibrium value of labour: \\[MPL= (1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} = w_t \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium wage}]\\] Equilibrium wage is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio \\(k_t\\) and TFP \\(A\\). The higher the capital-labour ratio or TFP, the more productive is an additional unit of labour input and the higher the wage. The demand for capital is decreasing in the interest rate whereas the current supply of capital per worker is independent of the interest rate and is determined by the savings of the “old” generation in the previous period, which in turns is determined by the wage received by the old generation in the previous period: \\[K_t = Na_t = N(1-\\alpha)w_{t-1} \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium capital stock}]\\] Therefore, the equilibrium capital input (\\(K_t\\)) is equal to its supply of capital at the beginning of the current period, and similarly for the equilibrium capital-labour ratio: \\[k_t = (1-\\alpha)w_{t-1} \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium capital-labour ratio}]\\] The equilibrium interest rate is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio \\(k_t\\) and TFP \\(A\\). \\[MPK= \\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} = r_t \\quad [\\text{Equilibrium interest rate}]\\] 3.5.2 The transition equation Derivation Because output and labour productivity depend on the capital stock (\\(K\\)), labour (\\(L\\)) and total factor productivity (\\(A\\)) and the last two are fixed parameters, only changes in the capital stock can explain changes in growth in this model economy. The transition equation is the key equilibrium condition of this model. The intuition for this equation is provided by the discussion in the previous section. What determines the capital stock in each period? The capital-labour ratio at time \\(t+1\\) (\\(k_{t+1}\\)) is determined by the assets accumulated by households of the “old” generation in the previous period (\\(a_{t+1}\\)), which was determined by the wage they earned in the previous period (\\(w_t\\)), which in turn was determined by the previous period capital-labour ratio (\\(k_t\\)). The transition equation makes this link between current and future capital-labour ratio appear more clearly: \\[k_{t+1} = a_{t+1} =(1-\\alpha)w_t = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A k_t^{\\beta} \\] The equilibrium value of the capital-labour ratio at any point in time \\(t+1\\) depends on the fixed parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(A\\) and on its value at time \\(t\\). In order to solve for the equilibrium values of \\(k_t\\) at each point in time, \\(t=0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\), we also need to know its initial value \\(k_0\\). The transition path diagram The transition path diagram represents the equilibrium values of \\(k_{t+1}\\) for all the possible values that can be taken by \\(k_t\\). The straight line is a 45-degree line whereby \\(k_{t+1}=k_t\\). To understand the dynamics of the equilibrium capital ratio, we can trace its time path starting with any initial value \\(k_0\\). The diagram represents one such time path. Starting from the initial value \\(k_0\\), the capital stock increases at \\(t=1\\) as the transition equation is above the 45-degree line. In the next period, starting with an initial value \\(k_1\\), the capital stock keeps increasing as the transition equation is still above the 45-degree line. This continues until the capital ratio reaches the value \\(\\bar{k}\\), at which point it remains constant. It is possible to show that starting at an initial value \\(k_0\\) above \\(\\bar{k}\\) would lead it to converge down towards \\(\\bar{k}\\) over time. \\(\\bar{k}\\) is the steady state value of the capital stock. It represents the equilibrium value of the capital ratio in the long-run. Why is the capital-labour ratio converging to a constant value? Assume for now that \\(\\alpha=0.5\\), so that young households save half of their first period labour income (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t\\)). For the capital stock to increase, young households’ savings must be higher than the current capital stock (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t&gt;k_t\\)). As the capital stock increases, the wage increases but by less and less with each additional increase in the capital stock (due to diminishing returns) and therefore so does the increase in the savings of the young. As the additional savings generated by an additional unit of capital falls over time, it will arrive a point where the savings of the young are just equal to the current capital stock (\\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t=k_t\\)). At this point, the saving of the young in each period is just enough to maintain the capital stock at the same level in each period. The capital stock will stabilise at this level and the economy will stop growing. 3.5.3 The full equilibrium In the previous section, We have seen how to calculate the equilibrium values of the capital ratio as function of the exogenous parameters of the model: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\). Once we have the equilibrium value of the capital ratio, it is possible to solve for the values of all the other endogenous variables of the model using the following relationships: \\[y_t = Ak_t^\\beta\\] \\[K_t = k_tN \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Y_t = y_tN\\] \\[ I_t = K_{t+1}-K_t \\] \\[ r_t = \\beta Ak_t^{\\beta -1} \\] \\[ w_t = (1-\\beta) Ak_t^{\\beta} \\] \\[c_{y,t}= \\alpha w_t \\] \\[a_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha) w_t \\] \\[c_{o,t+1}= (1 + r_{t+1}) a_{t+1} \\] \\[S_t = Y_t - Nc_{y,t} -Nc_{o,t} \\] 3.5.4 The steady state The steady state is defined as the long-run position towards which the economy converges, or the long run equilibrium. In this model, it corresponds to a situation in which the capital-labour ratio remains constant. Using the transition equation and this definition, it is possible to solve for the steady state value of the capital ratio \\(\\bar{k}\\): \\[ \\bar{k} = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A \\bar{k}^{\\beta}\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\bar{k} = [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)A]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}} \\] Because all the other variables of the model are determined by the capital-labour ratio, they also all converge to a constant steady state value. In other words, this model cannot explain growth in the long-run. 3.6 Analysis of shocks The exogenous parameters of the model (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\)) capture charateristics of the economic environment which may change as a result of shocks occurring outside of the model. For example, \\(\\alpha\\) captures the propensity to consume when young relative to when old and affects directly the share of labour income saved by young households, and therefore capital accumulation. This parameter may change due to cultural changes in the attitude of yonger generations towards the future, policies changing the incentives to save (eg taxation of savings), … An interesting exercise therefore is to analyse the effect of a shock to these parameters on growth (of capital, output, labour productivity, consumption) both on the short-run and long-run equilibrium values (ie the steady state) of the economy. For example, we can ask what would be the effect of a permanent rise in \\(\\alpha\\), ie an increase in young households’ propensity to consume, and therefore a fall in their saving on labour productivity growth in the long-run and the short-run. The diagram below shows how the transition path schedule would shift down on impact as for a given level of the capital ratio and income per worker the level of saving falls, leading to an immediate fall in the capital stock on the next period. The economy would then converge to a lower steady state value of the capital-labour ratio. The model therefore predicts that a rise in \\(\\alpha\\) would lead to a fall in the labour productivity growth rate in the short-run, but not in the long-run as the capital ratio stabilises at a new steady state level eventually. However, the shock would have a permanent negative effect on the level of the capital-labour ratio and therefore on the level of productivity growth since \\(y_t\\downarrow = A(k_t\\downarrow)^\\beta\\). 3.7 The life-cycle model with population growth So far we have assumed no population growth. To capture the fact that the population may be growing over time and analyse the effects of changes in the population growth rate on the equilibrium values of the variables in the model, we now assume that population is growing as follows: \\[ N_{y,t+1} = (1+n)N_{y,t}= (1+n)N_{o,t+1} \\] where \\(N_{y,t+1}\\) is the number of households in the young generation at time \\(t+1\\), \\(N_{y,t}\\) is the number of households in the young generation at time \\(t\\), which is the same as the number of households in the old generation at time \\(t+1\\), \\(N_{o,t+1}\\), and \\(n\\) is the constant exogenous growth rate of the population. Since the capital-labour ratio \\(k_t\\) represents the amount of capital per worker, it is now defined as the amount of capital per member of the young generation: \\[k_t=\\frac{K_t}{N_{y,t}}\\] and since labour productivity \\(y_t\\) represents the amount produced per worker it is now defined as the amount of output produced per member of the young generation: \\[y_t=\\frac{Y_t}{N_{y,t}}\\] Transition equation The equilibrium in the capital market states that the capital stock in the next period is equal to the assets accumulated by the current old generation in the previous period: \\[K_{t+1}= N_{o,t+1}a_{t+1} \\] Since everything else remains the same, assets at time \\(t+1\\) are still equal to \\(a_{t+1}=(1-\\alpha) w_t\\) and \\(w_t= (1-\\beta) Ak_t^{\\beta}\\), we can derive the transition equation as follows: \\[ k_{t+1} = \\frac{K_{t+1}}{N_{y,t+1}} =\\frac{N_{o,t+1}a_{t+1}}{N_{y,t+1}}= \\frac{a_{t+1}}{1+n} = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+n}w_{t} = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+n}(1-\\beta) Ak_t^{\\beta}\\] Transition path diagram The transition path diagram below conserves the same concave due to diminishing returns to capital. Along the equilibrium path, the economy will therefore still converge to a steady state where the capital-labour ratio is constant. Along the equilibrium path, the economy will therefore still converge to a steady state where the capital-labour ratio is constant. However now, the steady state capital-labour ratio is lower as the assets accumulated by the old generation in the previous period is now spread out over a higher number of households of the young generation in the current period. This means that more savings in the previous period will be required to maintain the same level of the capital-labour ratio. One can now ask what happens to the growth rate of the capital-labour ratio in the short-run when the population growth rate \\(n\\) changes. A rise in the population growth rate rotates the transition curve down. Since the initial steady state level of capital was just sufficient to generate savings required to maintain it at the same level, it is not enough to accommodate larger arrivals of young workers in the labour market. As a result, the capital-labour ratio falls in the short-run, before stabilising at a new lower steady state level in the long-run. The steady state in the model with population growth In the model with population growth, the equilibrium values of the variables of the model converge to different steady state growth rates. First, labour productivity \\(y\\), the wage \\(w\\), the interest rate \\(r\\) and all the other per worker variables such as consumption \\(c_y\\) and \\(c_o\\) and savings \\(a\\) are functions of the capital-labour ratio \\(k\\). Since the steady state value of the capital-labour ratio is constant, they also converge to a constant steady state value. In other words, as in the model without population growth, this model still cannot explain long-run growth in labour productivity and living standards. Second, output \\(Y\\), the capital stock \\(K\\) and consumption grow at the constant population growth rate \\(n\\). Using the definition of the capital-labour ratio, we know that \\(\\bar{k}=\\frac{K_t}{N_{y,t}}\\) in the steady state. Since \\(\\bar{k}\\) is constant and \\(N_{y,t}\\) grows at the rate \\(n\\), it must be that \\(\\bar{K}_t\\) is also growing at the rate \\(n\\) in the steady state. The same reasoning follows output. This model predicts that in an economy with no labour productivity growth, output would be growing at a constant rate in the long-run, equal to the population growth rate. 3.8 The life-cycle model with fiscal policy 3.8.1 The government intertemporal budget constraint The government intertemporal budget constraint (GIBC) can be written as follows: \\[ \\underbrace{B_t + \\frac{G_t}{R_t} + \\frac{G_{t+1}}{R_tR_{t+1}}+\\frac{G_{t+2}}{R_tR_{t+1}R_{t+2}} + ...}_{\\text{Current debt + Present value of government purchases}}= \\underbrace{\\frac{Z_t }{R_t} + \\frac{Z_{t+1}}{R_tR_{t+1}}+\\frac{Z_{t+2}}{R_tR_{t+1}R_{t+2}} + ...}_{\\text{Present value of net tax payments}} \\] where \\(B_t\\) is the current debt (the stock of government bonds), \\(G_t\\) is government spending (consumption), \\(Z_t\\) is net tax payments (the difference between the amount received by the government in tax revenues and transfers to households) and \\(R_{t+s} = 1+r_{t+s}\\) is the period \\(s\\) discount factor. The GIBC states that the sum of the current debt and the present value of future government spending (consumption) must be equal to the present value of future net tax payments. The implication for the conduct of fiscal policy in our model is that any increase in government spending \\(G_t\\) at time \\(t\\) must be financed either by an increase in net tax payments (a rise in tax revenues or a fall in transfers) \\(Z_t\\) at time \\(t\\) or by a rise in net tax payment in the future \\(Z_{t+s}\\) (\\(t=1, 2, 3, ...\\)). 3.8.2 Fiscal policy In this section, we assume no population growth, so there are the same number of households in each generation (\\(N\\)). Assume the government wants to finance government spending \\(\\bar{G}\\) at time \\(t\\) and all following periods. Furthermore, this additional government consumtpion is fully consume during the period, ie it has no impact on the economy’s capital stock or productivity in the subsequent periods. Because the GIBC must hold at all times, such an expenditure can be financed at time \\(t\\) either by taxation or by running a budget deficit (borrowing) which must be repaid by higher taxes in the future. Taxation (only) Assume current government purchases are financed in full by higher taxation in the current period. Net tax payments can either fall on young households or on old households as follows: \\[ Z_t = Nz_{y,t} + Nz_{o,t} \\] where \\(z_{y,t}\\) is net tax payments by young households and \\(z_{o,t}\\) is net tax payments by old households. We will only consider the two extreme cases where all the tax burden falls on the young or on the old households: The burden of taxation falls entirely on old households: \\[Z_t=Nz_{o,t}=N\\bar{g}=\\bar{G}\\] Each household of the old generation pays an equal share \\(\\bar{g}\\). The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to: \\[\\hat{z}= \\frac{z_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\\frac{\\bar{g}}{1+r_{t+1}}\\] The burden of taxation falls entirely on young households: \\[Z_t=Nz_{y,t}=N\\bar{g}=\\bar{G}\\] Each household of the old generation pays an equal share \\(\\bar{g}\\). The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to: \\[\\hat{z}= z_{y,t}=\\bar{g}\\] The tax burden is higher under the second scheme because households forego the interest rate they would have earned on their first period income by paying taxes. Deficit finance Assume current government purchases are financed in full by a budget deficit (higher borrowing) in the current period, which is fully repaid by higher taxation in the next period. \\[G_t = B_{t+1} = Nb_{t+1}\\] At \\(t\\): the government sells bonds \\(b_{t+1}\\) to “young” households. Young households purchase bonds at the beginning of period \\(t+1\\) with the savings they would have used to purchase capital assets. At \\(t+1\\): the government repays the amount borrowed from old households with interest \\((1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}\\) and simultaneously taxes them to raise the funds \\(z_{o,t+1} = (1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}\\) needed to pay these interest repayments. Deficit finance is deferred taxation. This gives the third method to finance government spending \\(\\bar{G}\\) at time \\(t\\): Deficit finance (borrowing): \\[\\bar{G} = B_{t+1} = Nb_{t+1}=N\\bar{g}\\] Each household of the old generation purchase an equal share \\(\\bar{g}\\) of the debt at the beginning of period \\(t+1\\) with their previous period saving, are repaid with interest at the end of the period and pay the same amount in tax. The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to: \\[\\hat{z}= \\frac{z_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\\frac{(1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\\bar{g}\\] Households’ tax burden over their lifetime in this third scheme is the same as under the second scheme. If households can fully anticipate that budget deficits today leads to higher taxation in the future, they should realise that financing higher government spending with higher debt is equivalent to being taxed more when young. 3.8.3 Equilibrium Fiscal policy only changes the consumption-saving decision of households, so we focus on the equilibrium conditions associated with households’ decisions. To simplify the exposition further, we will assume that households do not care about consumption when young (\\(\\alpha=0\\)). Although not a realistic assumption, this is not a crucial assumption to analyse the role of taxation on capital accumulation. Young household consumption: \\[c_{y,t} = \\alpha w_t = 0\\] Capital assets accumulated by young households (= Saving - bonds purchased): \\[a_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)w_t - \\ z_{y,t} -b_{t+1}=w_t - (\\ z_{y,t} +b_{t+1})\\] Old household consumption (= Income earned from capital assets and bonds minus taxation): \\[c_{o,t+1}= (1 + r_{t+1}) a_{t+1} + (1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1} - z_{o,t+1}\\] Transition equation: \\[ k_{t+1} = a_{t+1} = w_t - (\\ z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}) =(1-\\beta) A k_t^{\\beta} - ( z_{y,t} +b_{t+1} )\\] The equations for \\(Y_t\\), \\(L_t\\), \\(K_t\\), \\(y_t\\), \\(r_t\\), \\(S_t\\) and \\(I_t\\) describing how the endogenous variables of the model behave in equilibrium remain the same as before. The equilibrium now includes two new exogenous fiscal policy variables (\\(z_{y,t}\\), \\(z_{o,t+1}\\) or \\(b_{t+1}\\)) in addition the exogenous parameters (\\(\\beta\\), \\(A\\), \\(N\\) and \\(k_0\\)). 3.8.4 Transition Diagram, steady state and fiscal policy shocks The transition diagram conserves the same concave shape as in the model without fiscal policy due to diminishing returns to capital. However an increase in taxes on young households (the savers) or in the budget deficit rotates the transition path diagram clockwise. The steady state capital-labour ratio is now lower. In the absence of fiscal policy (\\(z_{y,t}=z_{o,t}=b_{t+1}=0\\)), savings would be fully invested in capital assets and contribute to the capital stock in the next period. With fiscal policy (\\(z_{y,t}+b_{t+1}&gt;0\\)), savings are reduced by the amount that needs to be paid in tax (\\(z_{y,t}\\)) and are used in part to purchase government debt \\(b_{t+1}\\). A the initial steady state level of the capital-labour ratio, the same wage leads to lower investment in capital assets and therefore a lower capital stock in the next period. This means that a higher wage in the previous period would be required to maintain the same level of the capital-labour ratio, which has become unsustainable. As a result, the economy converges to a lower steady state level of the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity. A fiscal policy shock affects capital accumulation and growth when the sum of taxation of the young and the debt (\\(z_{y,t}+b_{t+1}\\)) changes. A rise in either of these policies, holding everything else constant will lead the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity (and their growth) to fall for some time before stabilising permanently at a lower level. 3.8.5 Government investment So far we have assumed that government spending is fully consumed within the period. However, the government does invest in infrastructure projects, buildings, research, …, which adds to the capital stock. Transition equation To capture this fact, the capital stock at time \\(t+1\\) can be rewritten as: \\[K_{t+1} = Na_{t+1} + K_{t+1}^G\\] where \\(Na_{t+1}\\) is the privately-owned capital stock and \\(K_{t+1}^G\\) is government capital assets. Expressed per unit of labour, this gives the following revised transition equation: \\[ k_{t+1} = a_{t+1} + k_{t+1}^G = w_t - (z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}) + k_{t+1}^G =(1-\\beta) A k_t^{\\beta} - (z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}) + k_{t+1}^G\\] where \\(k_{t+1}^G\\) represents an additional channel through which government policy affects capital accumulation and growth. Transition path diagram To see the effect of government capital investment on growth and living standards in the long-run, we now turn to the transition diagram. For given initial levels of the capital labour ratio, taxation and debt, a rise in government investment (relative to pure government consumption or transfer) raises the capital labour ratio in the next period. This leads to a rise in labour productivity, the wage and savings, which raises further the capital stock.In the short-run, a rise in government spending on capital assets therefore raises growth. In the long-run, the economy converges to a new higher steady state level of the capital stock. Ultimately, government investment needs to be financed, leading to two possible cases: If \\(k^G_{t+1}\\) is financed by taxing the young or by borrowing (\\(z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}\\uparrow\\)) then the net effect on capital accumulation is null: government investment replaces private investment. If \\(k^G_{t+1}\\) is financed by taxing the old then the net effect on capital accumulation is positive.

Explain how households make consumption decision under the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) Describe how credit market imperfections affect household consumption decisions in the two-period life-cycle model. Analyse the effects of fiscal policy measures such as tax cuts and transfers on aggregate consumption. 4.1 Introduction You can find a more detailed discussion of the model in the main reference for this part of the course: Carlin, W. and Soskice D. (2023). Macroeconomics. Institutions, Instability, and the Financial system, 2nd Ed., Oxford University Press: Chapter 1 4.2 Multi-period model In the previous chapter, we saw how households choose optimally how much to consume by allocating resources (saving) over their lifetime in a two-period model where a period corresponds to approximately 30 years. To analyse the effect of temporary fiscal policies implemented to stabilise the economy over the business cycle, we need to consider shorter periods that last between a quarter and a year as well as the possibility for household to borrow. The multi-period model provides the conceptual framework to discuss consumption decisions over these shorter spans of time. 4.2.1 Model setup Assume Households live for an infinite number of periods, work, pay taxes and consume in all periods. Lifetime utility We assume that preferences for consumption over the lifetime are similar to those captured by the Cobb-Douglas utility function employed in the life-cycle model. However, to describe utility over more than two periods, it is easier to work with the logarithm version of the utility function. To see why the two functions are equivalent ways of representing the same preferences, let’s take the example of the two-period Cobb-Douglas utility function: \\[u_t = c_{t}^{\\alpha}c_{t+1}^{1-\\alpha}\\] and take the logarithm on both sides: \\[ln(u_t) = \\alpha ln(c_{t})+ (1-\\alpha)ln(c_{t+1})\\] Then divide both sides by \\(\\alpha\\): \\[\\frac{ln(u_t)}{\\alpha} = ln(c_{t})+ \\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha}ln(c_{t+1})\\] and simplifying: \\[ u^*_t = ln(c_{t}) + \\beta ln(c_{t+1}) \\] where \\(u^*_t =\\frac{ln(u_t)}{\\alpha}\\) is a monotonic transformation of the Cobb-Douglas utility which maintains the same utility ranking for each bundle of consumption. \\(\\beta=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\) captures the subjective value of consuming in period \\(t+1\\) relative to period \\(t\\) (time preference parameter). If \\(\\beta&lt;1\\) households value future consumption slightly less than present consumption. Lifetime utility over an infinite number of periods is represented by \\[ u_t = ln(c_{t}) + \\beta ln(c_{t+1}) + \\beta^2 ln(c_{t+2}) + ... \\] which implies that as consumption takes place further and further away in time, the utility derived from it today declines. In other words, households exhibit some degree of impatience (captured by \\(\\beta\\)). Lifetime budget constraint \\[\\underbrace{c_{t} + \\frac{c_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{c_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ...}_{\\text{Present value of consumption over the lifetime}} = \\underbrace{Assets_t+ y_t - t_t + \\frac{y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{y_{t+2}-t_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ...}_{\\text{Present value of lifetime income} \\: w_t} \\] \\(y_t - t_t\\): disposable income (income minus tax) \\(Assets\\): liquid (saving account) and illiquid assets (house) Consumption and disposable income are discounted by the interest rate \\(r\\) (the price of one unit of income one period from now), which is assumed to be constant over time. 4.2.2 Optimal consumption and the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) As before the household problem is to choose how much to consume in each period such that lifetime utility is maximised subject to the lifetime budget constraint. Household consumption problem: \\[ \\max_{c_{t},c_{t+1}} u_t = ln(c_{t}) + \\beta ln(c_{t+1}) + \\beta^2 ln(c_{t+2}) + ... \\] subject to \\[ c_{t} + \\frac{c_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{c_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ... = Assets_t+ y_t - t_t + \\frac{y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{y_{t+2}-t_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ... = w_t \\] The key optimality condition for this problem (= Consumption Euler equation) states that: \\[u&#39;(c_t) = (1+r)u&#39;(c_{t+1}) \\] where \\(u&#39;(c_t)=\\frac{1}{c_t}\\) and \\(u&#39;(c_{t+1})=\\frac{\\beta}{c_{t+1}}\\) are the marginal utility of consuming one additional unit of consumption in period \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\) respectively. This condition states that at the optimal consumption plan, households are indifferent between consuming an additional unit of consumption now or saving it, earning an interest \\(r\\) and consuming it in the next period. Assuming \\(\\beta(1+r)=1\\), households’ optimal consumption plan is to consume the same amount in all periods, equal to a constant fraction of their lifetime income: \\[c^*=\\frac{r}{1+r}w_t=y^P\\] where \\(w_t = Assets_t+ y_t - t_t + \\frac{y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{y_{t+2}-t_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ...\\) is lifetime income. \\(y^P\\) is the permament income (\\(\\approx\\) average per-period income). This expression for the optimal consumption plan \\(c^*\\) captures the key idea underlying the Permanent income hypothesis (PIH): current consumption depends on lifetime income (\\(w_t\\)) rather than current income (\\(y_t-t_t\\)). Consumption, according to this model is smoother over the business cycle than current disposable income because households take into account not only their current income (as in the Keynesian consumption function) but also their future expected income. The diagram illustrates the consumption-saving decision of PIH households over three periods of their life: households consume the same amunt (\\(Y^P\\)) in all period of their life and reallocate resources from one period to the next by either saving or borrowing. As a result, the PIH states that consumption should not track current income. Derivation Lagrangean function: \\[\\mathcal{L} = ln(c_{t}) + \\beta ln(c_{t+1}) + \\beta^2 ln(c_{t+2}) + ... + \\lambda[w_t - c_{t} - \\frac{c_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{c_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ...] \\] Where \\(\\lambda\\) is the Lagrangean multiplier (by how much consumption would increase if lifetime income increases by one unit). First-order conditions: \\[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_t} = \\frac{1}{c_t} - \\lambda =0\\] \\[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t+1}} = \\beta\\frac{1}{c_{t+1}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{1+r} =0\\] \\[ \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t+2}} = \\beta^2 \\frac{1}{c_{t+2}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{(1+r)^2} =0\\] Consumption Euler equation: \\[u&#39;(c_t) = \\beta(1+r)u&#39;(c_{t+1}) \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{c_t} = \\frac{\\beta(1+r)}{c_{t+1}} = \\frac{\\beta^2(1+r)^2}{c_{t+2}} = ...\\] Assuming \\(\\beta(1+r)=1\\), this last expression simplifies to: \\[c^*=c_t = c_{t+1}=c_{t+2}=... \\] Substituting it into the lifetime budget constraint and solving for \\(c_t^*\\): \\[ c^* + \\frac{c^*}{1+r} + \\frac{c^*}{(1+r)^2} + ... = w_t \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad c_t^* = \\frac{r}{1+r}w_t=y^P \\] where we have used \\(1 + \\frac{1}{1+r} + \\frac{1}{(1+r)^2} + ... = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{1+r}}= \\frac{1+r}{r}\\) 4.2.3 PIH prediction How does consumption responds when income changes? If households behave optimally, their consumption in each period follows: \\[ c_t^* = \\frac{r}{1+r}\\left(Assets_t+ y_t - t_t + \\frac{y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}}{1+r} + \\frac{y_{t+2}-t_{t+2}}{(1+r)^2} + ...\\right) \\] Using the intuition from this expression, we can derive the following predictions: Temporary and unanticipated shocks to disposable income do not have a large impact on current consumption. For example, assume that disposable income increases in period \\(t\\) only \\(y_t - t_t\\uparrow\\) and \\(r=0.05\\), then: \\[MPC =\\frac{\\partial c^*_t}{\\partial y_t - t_t}= \\frac{0.05}{1+0.05}\\approx 0.048\\] The marginal propensity to consume out of a temporary shock to income is small (households save most of the increase in income to spread its benefits over time). Permanent and unanticipated shocks to disposable income: \\[\\Delta (y_t - t_t)= \\Delta (y_{t+1}-t_{t+1})= \\Delta (y_{t+2}-t_{t+2}) = ...=\\Delta y^P\\] have a large impact on current consumption because permanent income increase by the same amount. \\[MPC =\\frac{\\partial c^*_t}{\\partial y^P}= 1\\] Anticipated (temporary or permanent) shocks to future disposable income affect current consumption at the time the news arrives but not at the time the shock is actually realised. For example, a temporary increase in income in period \\(t+1\\) (\\(y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}\\uparrow\\)) anticipated in period \\(t\\) should lead to the following responses (assuming \\(r=0.05\\)): \\[MPC =\\frac{\\partial c^*_t}{\\partial y_{t+1}-t_{t+1}} \\approx 0.048\\] Consumption at time \\(t\\) increases. However, in \\(t+1\\) households would be expected to consume the same amount as in period \\(t\\): \\(\\Delta C_{t+1}= C_{t+1} - C_t = 0\\). In other words, we should not observe a change in consumption patterns between period \\(t\\) and period \\(t+1\\). 4.3 Two-period model with credit constraints 4.3.1 Lifetime budget constraint We have seen that under the PIH, it may be optimal for households to borrow in one period of their life, while in other periods they would be saving, repaying their debt or running down their savings. This assumes that households are able to borrow in credit markets at the same rate they would receive on their savings. In practice, at any period of time some borrowers are not able to repay their debt and / or lie about their ability to repay their debt whereas others will repay their debt. The issue is that lenders (financial intermediaries) may not be able to observe perfectly the credit worthiness of borrowers (Assymmetric information problem). In order to recoup their losses, they will charge a higher rate to all borrowers, giving rise to a spread (or gap) between the rate at which borrowers can borrow funds to finance their current consumption needs and the interest rate they would be able to earn if they were saving some of their current income instead. Asymmetric information problems are likely to be more important during recessions when unemployment rises and income falls leading to more households defaulting on their debt. This will give rise to a kink in the lifetime budget constraint as represented on the diagram below. At the consumption bundle \\(E\\) (endowment point), households consume exactly their current income (and assets) in both periods, in other words in each period they are neither saving or dissaving. To the left of \\(E\\), households are savers in period \\(t\\) and earn interest rate \\(r_1\\) on their saving. To the right of \\(E\\), households are borrowers in period \\(t\\) and are charged an interest rate \\(r_2&gt;r_1\\) on their debt. Since the slope of the lifetime budget constraint (the rate at which consumption in period \\(t\\) can be exchanged for consumption in period \\(t+1\\)) is \\(-(1+r)\\), the lifetime budget constraint is steeper for borrower than for savers. 4.3.2 Optimal consumption The presence of credit constraints of this form may give rise to the situation described on the diagram above where some households would be willing to borrow at rate \\(r_1\\) and consume more in the current period and less in the future period (\\(D\\)) but are unable to. Note that the lower the level of initial assets (\\(A_t\\)), the more likely it is that households are going to find themselves in this situation. The presence of credit market imperfections (the spread) implies that the best they can achieve is to consume bundle \\(E\\), ie they consume all their current resources in both periods. How would such households react to a cut in their period \\(t\\) taxes? 4.3.3 Effect of tax cuts Assume the government cuts taxes in the current period (\\(t_t\\downarrow\\)), and this measure is fully funded by a tax rise in the future period (\\(t_{t+1}\\uparrow\\)) As shown in the diagram above, this measure expands households’ consumption possibilities in the current period and the endowment point shifts to \\(E_2\\). How does it change households’ optimal consumption plan? In the special case where the tax cut allows households to get closer to their optimal consumption bundle \\(D\\) but still does not allow them to achieve it, as represented on the diagram, their optimal consumption plan moves to \\(E_2\\) where once again they consume their current resource in both periods. This means that they will increase current consumption by the full amount of the tax cut. In other words, the marginal propensity to consume out of a tax cut is very large for credit constrained households. In the special case represented on the diagram it is equal to 1: \\[MPC = \\frac{\\partial c^{credit-constrained}_t}{\\partial t_t} = -1\\] Assuming a large fraction of households are credit-constrained, a tax cut will be effective at increasing current consumption. 4.4 Exercises with Copilot (Week 19) Although any large language model (LLM) can be used to do this exercise, we recommend using Microsoft Copilot for Edge browser, which is free of charge to all students through the University Microsoft license, to do these exercises.

Select the best three MCQs and propose them to one of your peers. Once you are confident you can answer all questions, ask for more difficult questions in a follow-up prompt (eg by adopting the persona of an researcher in academia). 4.5 Questions Some of these questions were adapted from ChatGPT propositions. Question 1 “A central implication of the life-cycle/permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH) is that consumers should not respond to predictable changes in their income.” (Hsieh, 2003). Which of these statements provides the most accurate explanation of this claim: Because consumers smooth consumption over time. Because income changes affect consumers’ decisions at the time the news of the change arrives, not at the time the shock is actually realised. Because consumers are credit constrained. Because as uncertainty falls, consumers are less likely to reduce their consumption following an income shock. Question 2 Which statement about the lifetime budget constraint in present value terms is most accurate? The household’s present value of consumption must equal the present value of income (plus any initial wealth). The household can consume more than its present value of lifetime income if it has access to borrowing. The household’s present value of consumption is always greater than its present value of income as long as the interest rate is positive. The household’s present value of consumption does not depend on the interest rate. Question 3 Consider a household that is credit-constrained. All else equal, how does being credit-constrained affect the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of a positive income shock? It typically lowers the MPC because the household will choose to save more of the income shock. It typically raises the MPC because the household cannot borrow as much as they would want against future income and therefore consumes more of any current shock. It has not impact on the MPC because households still base consumption only on permanent income. It makes the MPC exactly 0.5 since households always save half of their income. Question 4 How does the permanence of the income shock affect the household’s marginal propensity to consume? An entirely temporary shock leads to a higher MPC because the household recognises it only has a short time to enjoy the extra resources. An entirely permanent shock leads to a higher MPC because the household perceives a lasting increase in lifetime resources and adjusts current consumption accordingly. The MPC out of a permanent shock is lower than that out of a temporary shock because the household spreads the benefit over many periods. There is no difference in the MPC between a permanent and a temporary shock. Question 5 Which statement best describes how anticipation of an income shock affects the consumption response at the time the shock occurs? When a shock is unanticipated, households usually have no consumption response at the time the shock arrives. When a shock is fully anticipated, the immediate consumption response at the time the shock arrives is smaller than if the shock were a complete surprise. An unanticipated shock typically leads to smaller consumption response because households have not time to plan. An anticipated shock always leads to a larger MPC becasue hosueholds can plan to consume the entire shock immediately.

Interpret index series (Price indices, Industrial production indices, …) and construct indexed variables Construct annual growth rates of monthly or quarterly series to produce smooth series that are easier to interpret. Identify recessions using macroeconomic data and understand the issues and limitations associated with such an exercise. Use this knowledge to collect data and the appropriate data plots to describe a business cycle event. 5.1 Introduction Economic events of significance at the macroeconomic level generally involve developments occurring simultaneously in three markets, the market for goods, the labour market and the financial market. Equilibrium in each of these markets determines both the quantities produced and purchased and their prices, the changes of which are tracked by national statistical agencies to inform policymakers and are widely commented in the financial press. Goods market: the quantities are the consumption and investment goods and services that form GDP (on the expenditure side) and the associated price is the aggregate price level (which determines the inflation rate). Labour market: the quantity is the amount of labour employed (and the amount of labour that is not employed or the unemployment rate) and the associated price is the wage that is offered as a compensation for labour effort. Financial market: the quantity is the quantity of credit (and saving or lending) and its price is the cost of borrowing or the interest rate. Macroeconomic models of short-term business cycle fluctuations such as the 3-equation model developed in Carlin and Soskice (2015) attempt to explain the simultaneous change in each of these (endogenous) variables following (exogenous) shocks. 5.2 Describing the business cycle 5.2.1 Definitions The diagram below represents the hypothetical path taken by GDP around its long-run trend at the business cycle frequency. Figure 5.1: Business cycle diagram Potential output: long-run trend in output, which may also characterise the medium-run equilibrium output, consistent with equilibrium in the labour market. Output gap: deviation of actual from potential output (sometimes expressed as a %). Recessions and expansions: periods of decline or rise in economic activity. Peak: positive deviations from trends or expansions culminate in peaks, the turning point just before a recession. Trough: negative deviations from trends or recessions culminate in troughs, the turning point just before an expansion. Depth or amplitude of fluctuations: maximum deviation from trend (either negative or positive) during recessions and expansions. Frequency of cyclical fluctuations: number of peaks in GDP over a year. The plot below represents both the level of real GDP (black line, left axis) and its annual growth rate (green line, right axis) in the United States between 1945 and 2025. The shaded grey areas represent recessions (NBER). Figure 5.2: US Real GDP: level and annual growth rate (quarterly data) Several observations regarding the shape of the US business cycles emerge from the plot: The level of real GDP exhibits a steady increase over the 80 years. However the long-run trend is irregular, with periods of acceleration (late 1990s, mid-2000s, ..) and periods of stagnation (early 2000s, early 2010s, …). Recessions represent short-lived deviations around the long-run trend. These deviations span several months or quarters. In other words, they are persistent, making short-term predictions relatively easier (low growth in one quarter tends to be associated with low growth in the next quarter). Recessions and expansions are associated with sharp swings in real GDP growth, especially before the mid-1980s. The sharp swings that characterise turning points (peaks and troughs) suggest they are relatively unpredictable. The amplitude of business cycle fluctuations varies over time: GDP fell by up to 4% per year during the 2007-2009 recessions, up to 8% during the Covid pandemic, but did not fall during the 2001 recession. The frequency of fluctuations appears also to be irregular. The length of time between peaks and troughs of the business cycle (and therefore between recessions) varies over time and increased over the last 30 years. Although there are some regularities, each period of recession and expansion has therefore its specificity. Understanding these similarities and differences can provide useful insights into the causes of business cycle fluctuations as well as the role and effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Any study of business cycle events starts with a description grounded in observations of macroeconomic data. 5.2.2 Identifying recessions There is not one method of identifying recessions. In this section, we discuss various approaches to identify recessions. One commonly used definition in the financial press is that of two consecutive quarters of negative growth. This definition provides a useful starting point to identify recessions as it is easily implementable, requiring only data on quarterly real GDP: Collect quarterly real GDP data. Calculate the quarterly growth rate of real GDP using the formula defined in Section 1.2.1: \\[g_{GDP}= \\frac{GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}}-1\\] Identify quarters where GDP growth is negative for two consecutive quarters (6 months). Conclude that the economy was in a recession during these quarters only. In practice, there will be marginal cases where this method identifies false positives, ie periods of relative stagnation for two quarters when GDP falls but by a relatively small amount and without a widespread fall in activity across all sectors of the economy. Conversely, this method may fail to identify recessions when a quarter of negative growth occurs in between two quarters of negative growth, even though the event is associated with a large fall in economic activity and / or has a persistent effect on the labour market. For example, using this method, we would fail to identify a recession in 2001 in the United States as GDP growth was negative in the first and third quarters of 2001 but not in the second quarter. However, according to a committee of experts assembled into the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the US economy was in recession between the first and the thrid quarter of 2001. Here is how the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines recessions and expansions: Q: What is a recession? What is an expansion? A: The NBER’s traditional definition of a recession is that it is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months. The committee’s view is that while each of the three criteria — depth, diffusion, and duration — needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended. Q: What indicators does the committee use to determine peak and trough dates? A: The determination of the months of peaks and troughs is based on a range of monthly measures of aggregate real economic activity published by the federal statistical agencies. These include real personal income less transfers (PILT), nonfarm payroll employment, real personal consumption expenditures, manfacturing and trade sales adjusted for price changes, employment as measured by the household survey, and industrial production. There is no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions. Source: NBER Frequently Asked Questions. Note: key terms in bold have been highlighted by us. Thus the committee, in addition to real GDP, looks at a wider range of measures of economic activity spanning both the goods market and the labour market. To investigate further the fluctuations in economic activity that occurred in the US economy in 2001, we look at changes in the unemployment rates and in real earnin in the two figures below. Although more subdued than for the other two recessions over this sample period, we do observe a significant rise in the unemployment rate and a significant fall in the growth rate of earnings in 2001 in the United States, suggesting the slowdown in economic activity was relatively widespread and affected the labour market disproportionately more. These developments in the labour market can be used to motivate the classification of the event as a recession. 5.3 Collecting macroeconomic data In this section, we present four important sources of macroeconomic data for OECD economies which are freely available by government institutions and international organisations. Here are a few things to consider before collecting data: Real variables are expressed at constant prices (usually “Chained”) whereas nominal variables are expressed at current prices. To describe the level of economic activity, we are usually interested in real quantities (eg real GDP, real consumption, real investment, …). However, it is possible to compare the behaviour of two variables over time using nominal variables. Whenever possible, select seasonally adjusted data: seasonal patterns (eg increased spending around Christmas) have been removed to make it easier to observe business cycle fluctuations. Frequency of data: business cycle events develop over months and quarters, it is therefore preferable to use quarterly or monthly data to describe them precisely. 5.3.1 FRED The Federal Reserve Bank of Saint-Louis in the United States makes available a wealth of macroeconomic data for economies around the world via the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website: FRED Website Country specific data can be accessed via this page: FRED Website: Countries Note that the number of variables available for each country may vary. Example: Japan Real GDP The FRED database contains 2400 time series variables for Japan. Selecting seasonally adjusted quarterly real GDP data for Japan lands us on the page below, where the sample period can be adjusted. To download the data into an Excel spreadsheet, click on “Download” and select “Excel (data)”: You may choose the “Edit Graph” options to make some simple transformations “Units” (change the level of real GDP into the quarterly or the annual growth rate) and “Frequency” of the data. 5.3.2 OECD The OECD Data Explorer can be accessed via the following website: OECD Website Example: Japan (hourly earnings) As an example, let’s select the “Employment” category and go to “Benefits, earnings and wages”. Then scroll down and select “Hourly earnings”. In the “Reference area” write / select “Japan”. In “Frequency of observations &amp; Time period” leave the “Last” cell blank, select “Table” to visualise the series available. If you are happy with the data selected, download it in Excel format. 5.3.3 IMF To access International Financial Statistics compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF): IMF Data portal Website Leave the “Search IMF Data” box blank and click on “SEARCH”: Example: Japan (industrial production) Select “Japan” in the “Country” category, “Industrial Production”, in the “Topic” category, and “Production indexes (PI) in the”Datasets” category: The result of the search is that to find data on Industrial production in Japan we need to access the Production Indexes (PI) dataset. Clicking on the dataset, and then on “VIEW DATA”: Selecting “Japan”, “Quarterly” frequency, “All” periods and downloading the data: 5.3.4 Other useful sources of data The World Bank website may provide additional information to complement the (at the annual frequency only): World Bank Open Data Website To collect data for a specific country, click on “Country”: To download all the data available for the country of your choice (eg Japan), you can download the full dataset as an Excel spreadsheet: National statistical agencies, such as the ONS in the United Kingdom, may provide valuable sources of information. Government institutions (Central Bank, Parliament, …), such as the Bank of England in the United Kingdom or the Ministry of Finance in Japan, may also make freely available historical data on their website. 5.4 Data manipulations Data plots are used by economists to describe and compare the behaviour of different macroeconomic variables over the business cycle. In this section, we discuss some basic data manipulations that help convey meaningful information in data plots. 5.4.1 Frequency and data smoothing Frequency When describing business cycle fluctuations, we are interested in monthly fluctuations in macroeconomic variables rather than their annual fluctuations. Most economic data used to describe business cycle fluctuations is collected at the quarterly (GDP and its components) or monthly (CPI, industrial production, unemployment rate, interest rates, …) frequency. Some data is also collected at weekly (eg unemployment claims) or daily frequencies (some financial variables). We will focus on monthly and quarterly data in this chapter because these our the most pertinent frequencies for the purpose of our exercise. Note that a quarter corresponds to a period of three months. Smoothing data We have already discussed in Section 5.3 how it is preferable to collect seasonally adjusted data if we are interested in business cycle fluctuations. This data is constructed by employing a smoothing technique; removing the seasonal pattern which is associated with sharp changes in macroeconomic variables from one month to the next leads to a smoother data series. However, even after removing the seasonal component of a series, it may still be difficult to observe the trend in macroeconomic variables over the business cycle. To make comparisons more effective, it is usual to represent economic data in annual terms. Even if we use data (eg CPI inflation rate, GDP growth rate) at the monthly or quarterly frequency, we might want to express it in annualised terms (the rate at which a monthly or quarterly variable would have grown had it continued to grow at the same rate for a year). For example, using the monthly values of the CPI index, we calculate the monthly annualised inflation rate, ie the annual rate of inflation if the CPI were to grow at the same rate as in the current month for 12 months. See here for a more detailed discussion on annualising data. The plot below represents the monthly annualised CPI inflation rate in the United States: \\[\\pi_{CPI}^{annualised} = \\left[\\left( \\frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-1}}\\right)^{12} -1\\right]\\times 100 \\] The monthly inflation rate tends to be volatile, making it hard for the main trend to emerge at the monthly frequency. To obtain a clearer picture of the changes in the aggregate price level, we can calculate the annual inflation rate at the monthly frequency (ie the percentage change in the CPI between the current month and the same month the year before). \\[\\pi_{CPI}^{annual} = \\left[\\left( \\frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-12}}\\right) -1\\right]\\times 100 \\] The monthly annual inflation rate is represented in the plot below. The plot of the annual inflation rate is smoother, making it easier to observe the trends in inflation on a monthly basis. Similarly, it will be more effective to create a “smooth” plot of the growth rate of GDP, usually observed at a quarterly frequency, by representing the quarterly annual growth rate of GDP constructed as: \\[ g_{GDP}^{annual} = \\left[\\left( \\frac{GDP_t}{GDP_{t-4}}\\right) -1\\right]\\times 100 \\] In practice, other advanced methods are used by economists to smooth data series (such as using moving averages). 5.4.2 Indices and indexed variables Interpretation An index number is a data point that measures the value of a variable relative to a reference period, referred to as the base period and usually set equal to 100. Many macroeconomic variables tracking changes in quantities or prices of composite objects (eg cost of living, industrial production) and constructed by national statistical agencies and international institutions, take the form of indices. For example, headline measures of inflation are derived from Consumer Price Indices (CPI), Producer Price Indices, Retail Price Indices or the GDP deflator. Indices of industrial production, house price indices and stock price indices are other widely used measures of macroeconomic activity. The plot above represents one measure of the CPI in the United States, a measure of the cost of living as experienced by the average household, based on a fixed basket of consumption goods and services. The value of the CPI in January 2025 is equal to 324.739. It means that between 1983 (base period) and January 2025 the cost of living for the average household in the United States has increased by 324.7%. As we saw in the previous section, the Consumer Price Index can also be used to construct the rate of change in prices between any two time periods. Indexing macroeconomic variables to a common starting point To get a better understanding of the significance of economic events, it may not only be useful to follow what happens to important macroeconomic variables (eg GDP) independently, but to compare what happened to these variables relative to others within the same economy (eg consumption relative to investment, stock price index and dividend payments) or relative to the same variable in a different economy (eg GDP in the United Kingdom relative to GDP in the United States). The variables we might want to compare may be of different order of magnitude. For example, investment is much smaller than consumption, GDP in the United Kingdom is smaller that GDP in the United States. To better compare relative changes in variables of different magnitude, a widely used method is to index two (or more) variables to a common base period, so that all variables are equal to 100 in the base period and the new variables represent the change in the variables relative to the base period. For example, to compare the relative changes in GDP, consumption and investment in the United States during the 2001 recession using quarterly data, we would set the base period in the quarter preceding the start of the recession (2000Q4), so that each observation would give the level of consumption and investment in each quarter relative to their level just before the start of the recession. To index a variable \\(X\\) to a base period \\(t_0\\) (= base period) so that the indexed variable is equal to 100 in the base period, apply the following equation: \\[X_t^{index}=\\frac{X_t}{X_0 } × 100\\] The relevant base period to select depends on the questions that need to be addressed and therefore on the focus of the analysis. See here for a more detailed discussion on indexing variables. Example 1: GDP, consumption and investment during the 2001 US recession The plot below represents the change in real GDP, real consumption and real investment in the United States around the 2001 recession. All three variables have been indexed to the fourth quarter of 2000, which is the quarter just before the start of the recession (2001Q1-2001Q3), ie the peak of the previous expansion. Because we have indexed the variables to the quarter just before the recession, the plot allows us to address three types of questions: By how much did the level of each variable fall (ie what was the depth of the recession)? How long did it take for each variable to start growing at their trend (pre-recession) rate again? How long did it take for the level of each variable to rise back to their pre-recession level? Real GDP stagnated for 4 quarters between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2001. Although it then started rising again, it took two more years for GDP to start rising at its pre-recession rate. Real consumption stagnated for 3 quarters between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the third quarter of 2001. Consumption grew at a faster rate than GDP starting in the fourth quarter of 2001. Real investment declined by slightly more than 10% between 2000Q4 and 2001Q4. It took six more quarters for investment to start rising again at the pre-recession rate and two more years for investment to rise back to its pre-recession level. Example 2: comparing changes in GDP during the last three US recessions Instead of comparing the relative changes of different variables over the same period of time, we could compare the behaviour of GDP during different recessions that occurred in different periods or countries. The plot below represents the change in real GDP in the US during the last three recessions relative to the quarter just before the start of the recessions (period 0). The 2020 recession saw the largest and fastest deep in real GDP. The trough of the recession occured in the second quarter, by which time real GDP had fallen by 10% relative to its pre-recession level. The 2007-2009 recession had the longest impact on the level of real GDP, which only recovered its pre-recession level 12 quarters (3 years) after the start of the recession. By the time the recession had reached its trough, seven quarters into the recession, real GDP had fallen by 3.2% relative to its pre-recession level. The 2001 recession was the mildest in terms of real GDP loss. It only fell by 0.3% relative to pre-recession level in the firts qurter of the recession. However, compared to the 2020 recession, it was followed 8-9 quarters of weak growth.
