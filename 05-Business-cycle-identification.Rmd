## Introduction

Economic events of significance at the macroeconomic level generally involve developments occurring simultaneously in three markets, the market for goods, the labour market and the financial market. Equilibrium in each of these markets determines both the quantities produced and purchased and their prices, the changes of which are tracked by national statistical agencies to inform policymakers and are widely commented in the financial press. 

1. **Goods market**: the quantities are the consumption and investment goods and services that form GDP (on the expenditure side) and the associated price is the **aggregate price level** (which determines the inflation rate). 
1. **Labour market**: the quantity is the amount of labour employed (and the amount of labour that is not employed or the unemployment rate) and the associated price is the **wage** that is offered as a compensation for labour effort. 
1. **Financial market**: the quantity is the quantity of credit (and saving or lending) and its price is the cost of borrowing or the **interest rate**. 

Macroeconomic models of short-term business cycle fluctuations such as the 3-equation model developed in Carlin and Soskice (2015) attempt to explain the simultaneous change in each of these (endogenous) variables following (exogenous) shocks.

## Describing the business cycle

The diagram below represents the hypothetical path taken by GDP around its long-run trend at the business cycle frequency. 

```{r BC_DIAGRAM, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", out.height="65%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/BC_DIAGRAM.png"))

```

**Some useful definitions**: 

- **Potential output**: long-run trend in output, which may also characterise the medium-run equilibrium output, consistent with equilibrium in the labour market.
- **Output gap**: deviation of actual from potential output (sometimes expressed as a \%).
- **Recessions and expansions**: period of decline or rise in economic activity.
- **Peak**: positive deviations from trends or expansions culminate in peaks, the turning point just before a recession.
- **Trough**: negative deviations from trends or recessions culminate in troughs, the turning point just before an expansion.
- **Depth** or **amplitude** of fluctuations: maximum deviation from trend (either negative or positive) during recessions and expansions.
- **Frequency** of cyclical fluctuations: number of peaks in GDP over a year.

The plot below represents both the level of real GDP (black line, left axis) and its annual growth rate (green line, right axis) in the United States between 1945 and 2025. The shaded grey areas represent recessions (NBER).

```{r RGDPA, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/RGDPA.png"))

```

Several observations regarding the shape of the US business cycles emerge from the plot: 

1. The level of real GDP exhibits a steady increase over the 80 years. However the long-run trend is **irregular**, with periods of acceleration (late 1990s, mid-2000s, ..) and periods of stagnation (early 2000s, early 2010s, ...).
1. Recessions represent short-lived deviations around the long-run trend. These deviations span several months or quarters. In other words, they are **persistent**, making short-term predictions relatively easier (low growth in one quarter tends to be associated with low growth in the next quarter). 
1. Recessions and expansions are associated with **sharp swings in real GDP growth**, especially before the mid-1980s. The sharp swings that characterise turning points (peaks and troughs) suggest tehy are relatively unpredictable.
1. The **amplitude of business cycle fluctuations** varies over time: GDP fell by up to 4% per year during the 2007-2009 recessions, up to 8% during the Covid pandemic, but did not fall during the 2001 recession.
1. The **frequency of fluctuations** appears also to be irregular. The length of time between peaks and troughs of the business cycle (and therefore between recessions) varies over time and increased over the last 30 years. 

Although there are some regularities, each period of recession and expansion has therefore its specificity. Understanding these similarities and differences can provide useful insights into the causes of business cycle fluctuations as well as the role and effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Any study of business cycle events starts with a description grounded in observations of macroeconomic data.

## Collecting macroeconomic data

In this section, we present four important sources of macroeconomic data for OECD economies which are freely available by government institutions and international organisations. 

*Here are a few things to consider before collecting data*:

- **Real** variables are expressed at constant prices (usually "Chained") whereas **nominal** variables are expressed at current prices. To describe the level of economic activity, we are usually interested in real quantities (eg real GDP, real consumption, real investment, ...). However, it is possible to compare the behaviour of two variables over time using nominal variables. 
- Whenever possible, select **seasonally adjusted data**: seasonal patterns (eg increased spending around Christmas) have been removed to make it easier to observe business cycle fluctuations. 
- **Frequency of data**: business cycle events develop over months and quarters, it is therefore preferable to use *quarterly* or *monthly* data to describe them precisely. 


### FRED 

The Federal Reserve Bank of Saint-Louis in the United States makes available a wealth of macroeconomic data for economies around the world via the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website: [<span style="color: blue;"> **FRED Website** </span>](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

Country specific data can be accessed via this page: [<span style="color: blue;"> FRED Website: Countries </span>](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

*Note that the number of variables available for each country may vary*. 

**Example: Japan Real GDP**

The FRED database contains 2400 time series variables for Japan.

```{r OECD_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/OECD_1.png"))

```

**Example: Japan (hourly earnings)**

As an example, let's select the "Employment" category and go to "Benefits, earnings and wages". Then scroll down and select "Hourly earnings".

```{r OECD_2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/OECD_2.png"))

```

In the "**Reference area**" write / select "Japan".

```{r OECD_3, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/OECD_3.png"))

```

In "**Frequency of observations & Time period**" leave the "Last" cell blank, select "Table" to visualise the series available. If you are happy with the data selected, download it in Excel format. 

```{r OECD_4, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

## Data manipulations

Data plots are used by economists to describe and compare the behaviour of different macroeconomic variables over the business cycle. In this section, we discuss some basic data manipulations that help convey meaningful information in data plots.


### Frequency and data smoothing

**Frequency**

When describing business cycle fluctuations, we are interested in monthly fluctuations in macroeconomic variables rather than their annual fluctuations. Most economic data used to describe business cycle fluctuations is collected at the **quarterly** (GDP and its components) or **monthly** (CPI, industrial production, unemployment rate, interest rates, ...) frequency. Some data is also collected at **weekly** (eg unemployment claims) or **daily** frequencies (some financial variables). We will focus on monthly and quarterly data in this chapter because these our the most pertinent frequencies for the purpose of our exercise. Note that a *quarter* corresponds to a period of *three* months.

**Smoothing data**

We have already discussed in Section 5.3 how it is preferable to collect *seasonally adjusted data* if we are interested in business cycle fluctuations. This data is constructed by employing a *smoothing* technique; removing the seasonal pattern which is associated with sharp changes in macroeconomic variables from one month to the next leads to a smoother data series. However, even after removing the seasonal component of a series, it may still be difficult to observe the trend in macroeconomic variables over the business cycle. 

To make comparisons more effective, it is usual to represent economic data in annual terms. Even if we use data (eg CPI inflation rate, GDP growth rate) at the monthly or quarterly frequency, we might want to express it in *annualised* terms (the rate at which a monthly or quarterly variable would have grown had it continued to grow at the same rate for a year). For example, using the monthly values of the CPI index, we calculate the monthly annualised inflation rate, ie the annual rate of inflation if the CPI were to grow at the same rate as in the current month for 12 months. See [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/annualizing) for a more detailed discussion on annualising data. 

The plot below represents the monthly *annualised* CPI inflation rate in the United States:
$$\pi_{CPI}^{annualised} = \left[\left( \frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-1}}\right)^{12} -1\right]\times 100  $$

```{r CPI_m, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CPI_m.png"))

```

The monthly inflation rate tends to be volatile, making it hard for the main trend to emerge at the monthly frequency. To obtain a clearer picture of the changes in the aggregate price level, we can calculate the *annual* inflation rate at the monthly frequency (ie the percentage change in the CPI between the current month and the same month the year before). 
$$\pi_{CPI}^{annual} = \left[\left( \frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-12}}\right) -1\right]\times 100  $$
The monthly annual inflation rate is represented in the plot below. The plot of the *annual* inflation rate is smoother, making it easier to observe the trends in inflation on a monthly basis. 

```{r CPI_a, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CPI_a.png"))

```

Similarly, it will be more effective to create a "smooth" plot of the growth rate of GDP, usually observed at a quarterly frequency, by representing the quarterly annual growth rate of GDP constructed as:
$$ g_{GDP}^{annual} = \left[\left( \frac{GDP_t}{GDP_{t-4}}\right) -1\right]\times 100   $$

*In practice, other advanced methods are used by economists to smooth data series (such as using moving averages).*

### Indices and indexed variables

**Interpretation**

An *index number* is a data point that measures the value of a variable relative to a reference period, referred to as the *base period* and usually set equal to 100. Many macroeconomic variables tracking changes in quantities or prices of composite objects (eg cost of living, industrial production) and constructed by national statistical agencies and international institutions, take the form of indices. For example, headline measures of inflation are derived from Consumer Price Indices (CPI), Producer Price Indices, Retail Price Indices or the GDP deflator. Indices of industrial production, house price indices and stock price indices are other widely used measures of macroeconomic activity. 

```{r CPI_Index, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CPI_Index.png"))

```

The plot above represents one measure of the CPI in the United States, a measure of the cost of living as experienced by the average household, based on a fixed basket of consumption goods and services. The value of the CPI in January 2025 is equal to 324.739. It means that between 1983 (base period) and January 2025 the cost of living for the average household in the United States has increased by 324.7%. However as we saw in the previous section, the Consumer Price Index can be used to construct the rate of change in prices between any two time periods.

**Indexing macroeconomic variables to a common starting point**

To get a better understanding of the significance of economic events, it may not only be useful to follow what happens to important macroeconomic variables (eg GDP) independently, but to compare what happened to these variables *relative* to others within the same economy (eg consumption relative to investment, stock price index and dividend payments) or *relative* to the same variable in a different economy (eg GDP in the United Kingdom relative to GDP in the United States). 

The variables we might want to compare may be of different order of magnitude. For example, investment is much smaller than consumption, GDP in the United Kingdom is smaller that GDP in the United States. To better compare relative changes in variables of different magnitude, a widely used method is to *index* two (or more) variables to a common base period, so that all variables are equal to 100 in the base period and the new variables represent the change in the variables relative to the base period. 

For example, to compare the relative changes in GDP, consumption and investment in the United States during the 2001 recession using quarterly data, we would set the base period in the quarter preceding the start of the recession (2000Q4), so that each observation would give the level of consumption and investment in each quarter relative to their level just before the start of the recession.

To *index* a variable $X$ to a base period $t_0$ (= base period) so that the indexed variable is equal to 100 in the base period, apply the following equation:
$$X_t^{index}=\frac{X_t}{X_0 } × 100$$

The relevant base period to select depends on the questions that need to be addressed and therefore on the focus of the analysis. 

*See [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/indexing) for a more detailed discussion on indexing variables.*

**Example 1**

The plot below represents the change in real GDP, real consumption and real investment in the United States around the 2001 recession. All three variables have been indexed to the fourth quarter of 2000, which is the quarter just before the start of the recession (2001Q1-2001Q3), ie the peak of the previous expansion. 

```{r 2001_US_Recession, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/2001_US_Recession.png"))

```

Because we have indexed the variables to the quarter just before the recession, the plot allows us to address three types of questions: By how much did the level of each variable fall (ie what was the depth of the recession)? How long did it take for each variable to start growing at their trend (pre-recession) rate again? How long did it take for the level of each variable to rise back to their pre-recession level?

**Real GDP** stagnated for 4 quarters between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2001. Although it then started rising again, it took two more years for GDP to start rising at its pre-recession rate. **Real consumption** stagnated for 3 quarters between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the third quarter of 2001. Consumption grew at a faster rate than GDP starting in the fourth quarter of 2001. **Real investment** declined by slightly more than 10% between 2000Q4 and 2001Q4. It took six more quarters for investment to start rising again at the pre-recession rate and two more years for investment to rise back to its pre-recession level. 

**Example 2**

Instead of comparing the relative changes of different variables over the same period of time, we could compare the behaviour of GDP during different recessions that occurred in different periods or countries. The plot below represents the change in real GDP in the US during the last three recessions relative to the quarter just before the start of the recessions (period 0). 

```{r US_Recessions, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/US_Recessions.png"))

```

The **2020 recession** saw the largest and fastest deep in real GDP. The trough of the recession occured in the second quarter, by which time real GDP had fallen by 10% relative to its pre-recession level. The **2007-2009 recession** had the longest impact on the level of real GDP, which only recovered its pre-recession level 12 quarters (3 years) after the start of the recession. By the time the recession had reached its trough, seven quarters into the recession, real GDP had fallen by 3.2% relative to its pre-recession level. The **2001 recession** was the mildest in terms of real GDP loss. It only fell by 0.3% relative to pre-recession level in the firts qurter of the recession. However, compared to the 2020 recession, it was followed 8-9 quarters of weak growth.

## Useful transformations


## Identifying recessions

### Definitions

In the first quarter of 2001, according to a committee of experts assembled into the <a href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions" target="_blank">*NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee*</a>, the US economy entered a recession. In addition to hosting the Business Cycle Dating Committee, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is a network of academic economists organised in research programs, publishing a working paper series, organising conferences, ... 

Here is how it defines recessions and expansions:

> **Q: What is a recession? What is an expansion?**

> A: The NBER's traditional definition of a **recession** is that it is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months. The committee's view is that while each of the three criteria — **depth**, **diffusion**, and **duration** — needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 **peak** in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the **trough** occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. **Expansion** is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended.

*Source: <a href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">*NBER Frequently Asked Questions*</a>*.

*Note*: key terms in bold have been highlighted by us. 

This definition goes beyond the common definition widely used in the financial press of two consecutive quarters of negative quarterly growth, which nevertheless provides a good starting point to start thinking about the identification of recessions.

## Exercises (Week 20)


In this class, we will discuss several tools to identify business cycle events. We will use the “US_DATA” Excel spreadsheet which contains data collected from the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database. The dataset contains time series of macroeconomic variables related to volumes and prices in the three markets used to describe macroeconomic fluctuations: 
	
- Market for goods: GDP and its components (consumption, investment and government spending) and prices (CPI, GDP deflator)
- Labour market: employment, unemployment and wages
- Financial market: credit, private and public debt, interest rates, asset prices

It also contains data related to the production sector (industrial production, PPI, sector-specific measures of activity and income). A complete analysis of a business cycle event should keep track of what is happening in all three markets.
The legend sheet provides information regarding the variables in the dataset. You may also check the FRED website (which can be accessed here) to complement this information if needed.

### Exercise 1: Indexing: construction and interpretation {-}

National statistical agencies construct index measures of prices and economic activity to summarize within a single measure key macroeconomic trends in production (industrial production index) and prices (CPI, GDP deflator). The latter are used to construct inflation measures. 

The analyst may also want to transform measures of economic activity (eg GDP) by indexing them to a common starting point. These can be used to quickly evaluate the percentage change in a variable between an initial point and any subsequent period and to compare the growth rates of variables of different magnitude. 

**PART A: Price indices and inflation**
	
a. What do the CPI and the GDP deflator represent? What is the difference between the CPI and the GDP deflator?
a. The measure of the consumer price index in this dataset is indexed with base year 1982-1984 (1983 to simplify). In January 2025, the CPI is equal to 324,739. What does this number represent?
a. Using the variable CPILFESL (“MONTHLY” sheet), calculate the annual inflation rate and represent it on a line plot. What was the annual inflation rate in September 2024 in the United States?

**PART B: Indexing variables to a common starting point**

By indexing a variable X to a base period t_0 (= base period) so that the indexed variable is equal to 100 in the base period, apply the following equation:
$$X_t^{index} = \frac{X_t}{X_0}\times 100 $$

a. Copy the variables GDPC1, PCECC96 and GPDIC1 (“QUARTERLY” sheet) and between 1999Q1 and 2005Q4 on a new sheet. Calculate the indexed values of each of the three variables using 2000Q4 as the base period. Plot the three indexed series on the same line plot.
a. Using the variable DIVIDEND (“QUARTERLY” sheet), construct an indexed series of corporate dividends using 1971Q1 as the base period. Represent the series together with the NASDAQCOM series on the same line plot. 


### Exercise 2: Identifying and describing recessions {-}

There is not one method of identifying recessions. However, one commonly used definition which can be used as a starting point is that of two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Other useful concept that ae helpful to identify and describe business cycles and recessions are that of peak and trough. The peak of a business cycle is achieved in the quarter before the start of a recession and the trough of a recession is achieved in the quarter before the start of the recovery.   

**PART A: Identifying recessions using GDP data**

a. Using the variable GDPC1 (“QUARTERLY” sheet) between 2000Q1 and 2024Q2, construct the series of quarterly GDP growth rate.
a. Identify all the quarters where there are at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth rates and compare them with the three recessions identified by the NBER dating committee (here). Do you notice any difference?
a. For each of the three NBER recessions in this period, create an indexed series of GDP value with base period equal to the quarter before the start of the recession (Note: you have already calculate this for the 2001 recession in Exercise 1 PART Ba). Represent the indexed series on the same plot for up to 20 quarters after the start of the recession. Use this plot to compare the depth of the recessions and identify the trough of the recessions. 

**PART B: Using production and labour market data**

a. Plot the variable UNRATE (“MONTHLY” sheet) between 2000Q1 and 2024Q4. For each recession, by how much did the unemployment rate increase following each recession? When was maximum unemployment achieved?
a. Using the variable INDPRO (“MONTHLY” sheet) between 2000Q1 and 2024Q4, by how much has industrial production declined from peak to trough in each recession. 

### Exercise 3: Identifying asset price bubbles and financial shocks {-}

**PART A: Asset price bubbles**

Stocks are financial assets that pay dividends to their owners. Dividends are paid out of firms’ profits and tend to increase when profits increase. What determines the price of a stock that promises a stream of dividends in the future?
$$Q_t = \frac{E(D_t)}{1+r} + \frac{E(D_{t+1})}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{E(D_{t+3})}{(1+r)^3} + ... $$

The current price of the stock $Q_t$ is equal to the present discounted value of future expected dividends (the fundamental value of a stock). Stock prices are predicted to increase when expected future profits are higher and when current and expected future interest rates fall. An asset price bubble arises when the price of the stock increases faster than warranted by future expected dividends. 

a. According to investment theory, what changes to investment expenditures should we observe following a rise in stock prices due to a rise in expected future dividends? A rise in stock prices due to excessive optimism among investors?
a. The Nasdaq is one of the most followed stock price index, placing a heavy weight on companies in the information technology sector. Plot the Nasdaq series alongside the index dividend series (See Exercise 1 PART Bb). Is the information on the plot consistent with the presence of an asset price bubble in the early 2000s?

**PART B: Financial stress**

Yield spreads, the difference between the rates on risky debt instruments (usually corporate bonds with a low rating) and interest rate on safer debt (corporate bonds with good ratings or government bond). They capture difficulties for firms to fund their investment projects in financial markets.

Financial stress indices provide summaries more encompassing of financial stress which may affect financial intermediaries directly. The St-Louis Fed Financials Stress index is one such measure for the United States (see here). 

a. Using data in the “QUARTERLY” sheet, construct the yield spread between the AAA Corporate bond yield (WAAA) and the BAA Corporate bond yield (WBAA) and represent it on the same graph as the annual real investment growth rate (GCEC1). 
a. (Optional) Represent the yield spread constructed above and the financial stress index and compare the two measures of financial stress. 


### Exercise 4 (Optional): Describing the 2001 recession in the US {-}

a. Using the remaining information in the dataset, describe what happened during the 2001 recession in the US by creating an appropriate plot:

- Government spending and government debt 
- Wages and corporate profits
- Capacity utilization and unemployment duration

a. Describe the main characteristics of the 2001 recession in the United States using the information uncovered in all three exercises. What were the main trends and how is it different from the other recessions?
