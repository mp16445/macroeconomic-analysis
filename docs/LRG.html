<hr />
<p>In this chapter, we will develop some useful tools to describe the long-run growth trends of macroeconomic variables and to think about the mechanisms behind these growth trajectories.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate <em>growth rates</em>.</li>
<li>Understand the role of <em>compounding effects</em> in modern growth trends and beyond.</li>
<li>Construct and interpret plots of <em>logarithms</em> and plots with <em>logarithm (ratio) scales</em>.</li>
<li>Investigate <em>convergence facts</em> using scatter plots.</li>
<li>Perform all these operations in <em>Excel</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use data from the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2023" target="_blank"><em>Maddison Project Database 2023</em></a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-BJZL_2024">Bolt, Jutta and van Zanden, Jan Luiten 2024</a>)</span> and the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/" target="_blank"><em>Penn World Table</em></a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-PWT">Feenstra, Inklaar, and P.Timmer 2015</a>)</span>, allowing us to compare <em>real</em> economic outcomes over time and across countries. GDP in this chapter will always refer to real GDP although this may not be explicitly mentioned for simplicity in the text.</p>

Figure 1.1: Long-run trends in GDP per capita: 1700-2022
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot1">1.1</a> represents real GDP per capita over more than three centuries for fifteen of today’s most important economies. Viewed through the lenses of GDP per capita, this data tells us a story of growing global wealth (or standards of living) and inequality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern growth is a relatively recent phenomenon</strong>: GDP per capita was relatively constant in all countries until the late 18th century. It then started to increase exponentially in all countries at some point over the last 200 years. In most countries this led to GDP per capita being multiplied by a factor of 10 or more.</li>
<li><strong>The great divergence</strong>: This exponential growth pattern started at different times for different countries and there is nothing to suggest that the countries lagging behind will eventually catch up to the most advanced economies. The difference between the richest and the poorest countries in this sample has grown from a factor of 4 to 5 in 1800 (UK GDP per capita was 5 times higher than in Indonesia) to a factor of 10 to 11 in 2018 (US GDP per capita was 11 times higher than in Nigeria).</li>
<li><strong>A variety of experiences</strong>: Looking at the plot more closely, the path has not been entirely smooth in most countries, with some countries such as the Russian Federation, Japan or South Africa experiencing decades of stagnation or decline in the last 50 years. Some of the poorest countries, not represented here, have seen little to no growth as well as periods of prolonged decline over the same period.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should not be concluded from this first foray into long-run GDP growth trends that the processes underlying them are deterministic in the sense that they are produced by irrepressible forces largely beyond the control of human organisations or that they are normative in the sense that exponential growth represents the ultimate goal of human societies. Rather, the trends we observe reflect the outcomes of historical processes in different societies at different points in time. They are made possible by specific institutional, geographical, cultural characteristics and shaped by relationships of power within and between countries.</p>
<div id="growth-rates-and-the-power-of-compunding-effects" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Growth rates and the power of compunding effects<a href="LRG.html#growth-rates-and-the-power-of-compunding-effects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The dynamics of GDP levels over the long term observed in Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot1">1.1</a> are the result of growth processes that are cumulative over time. Each year, the economy is able to build on the previous level of production to generate more output, which allows for further increases in output in the following year, etc… In this view, the <strong>growth rate</strong> of output from one year to the next is a useful indicator of the ability of an economy to generate more output over time, which can be used to compare the performance of economies of different sizes and at different points in time. Economic theories of growth seek to understand the mechanisms that drive these changes in output over time and the reason why growth rates may differ across countries.</p>
<p>Two comparisons shed some light on the relationships between growth rates and changes in the levels of GDP in the long-run.</p>
<p><strong>1. Why have American on average much bigger fridges and bigger cars than the average Briton?</strong></p>
<p>Between 1885 and 2022, GDP per capita in the United Kingdom increased from $6,132 to $38,407 (2011 dollars). Standards of living have therefore been multiplied by more than 6 in this country over this period. In contrast, GDP per capita in the United States over the same period has increased from $6,424 to $58,487 (2011 dollars) so that standards of living have been multiplied by 9. Starting at a similar level as in the United Kingdom, GDP per capita in the United States has therefore grown at a faster rate and is now about 50% higher. How much higher must have been the annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States relative to the United Kingdom to arrive at this outcome?</p>
<p><strong>2. Why has GDP per capita in Nigeria not converge to that of the United Kingdom?</strong></p>
<p>GDP per capita in Nigeria has increased from $810 to $5,070 (2011 dollars) between 1885 and 2022. Therefore in both the United Kingdom and Nigeria, standards of living have been multiplied by slightly more than 6 over this period. As we will see, this means that they have grown at the same average annual growth rate over this period. As a result, the two countries have not diverged further over this period but they have not converged either; the United Kingdom was slightly more than 7.5 times richer than Nigeria in 1885 and it is still a bit more than 7.5 times richer than Nigeria in 2022. Two countries starting at different levels of GDP per capita but growing at the same annual growth rate will not converge. For GDP per capita in Nigeria to have converged to that of the United Kingdom over this period, how much higher should its annual growth rate have been on average?</p>
<p>The answer to both questions is probably less than you would expect due to the power of compounding effects. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to reformulate these problems in mathematical terms and solve for the precise answers. You will also be equipped to produce informative graphical representations of growth trajectories (using the power of logarithms) and use these techniques to extract some relevant facts about growth in countries across the world and over time.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Per-period growth rate: definition and calculation<a href="LRG.html#per-period-growth-rate-definition-and-calculation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most economic variables are observed at <em>discrete</em> time intervals. For example, to produce the plot in Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot1">1.1</a>, we used annual observations of GDP per capita (<em>see</em> Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:DiscreteTab">1.1</a>). GDP is only observed at separate points in time. Time is discrete in the sense that it only takes on integer values, for example <span class="math inline">\(t=2000, 2001, ..., 2004\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>per-period growth rate</strong> of GDP in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the <em>percentage change</em> in GDP between period <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> and period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Formally, the growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> of variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (where the period may be a year, a quarter, a month, a day, …) is calculated as:
<span class="math display">\[g_t = \frac{\Delta y_t}{y_{t-1}} = \frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} = \frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}-1\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y_t=y_t-y_{t-1}\)</span> is the <em>discrete time change</em> in variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Expressed in percentage terms, this becomes:
<span class="math display">\[\%g_t=\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \times 100 \]</span>
Using this formula and our annual GDP per capita data in Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:DiscreteTab">1.1</a>, we can calculate the <em>annual growth rate</em> of GDP per capita between two consecutive years. For example, the growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States in 2001 is given by:
<span class="math display">\[\% GDP_{2001}=\left(\frac{GDP_{2001}}{GDP_{2000}}-1\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{45878}{45886}-1\right) \times 100 = -0.017\%\]</span></p>
<p>Note that a growth rate can be negative. In this case, it simply means that the value of goods and services produced per person in the United States declined between 2000 and 2001. Column 3 of Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:DiscreteTab">1.1</a> shows the annual growth rate of US GDP per capita in the following years.</p>

<p>Having seen how to calculate the growth rate of GDP from one year to the next in the previous section, we turn our attention in this section to the estimation of the trend growth rate of GDP over one or several decades, ie the growth rate around which annual growth rates tend to fluctuate. A trend growth rate provides a clearer summary of long-run trends than the annual growth rates presented in Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:DiscreteTab">1.1</a>, as it abstracts from short-run annual fluctuations.</p>
<p>How can we calculate the annual trend growth rate? Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot3">1.2</a> represents actual GDP per capita in the United States between 1870 and 2018 (black solid line) and an estimate of the trend in GDP per capita over the same period (dashed red line). We want to obtain an estimate of the annual growth rate of GDP per capita along this trend growth path. There are several valid methods to do so but there is at least one very incorrect one.</p>

</div>
<p>GDP per capita in the United States increased from $4,803 in 1870 to $55,335 in 2018. You might be tempted to calculate the trend annual growth rate over these 148 years as the percentage change in GDP between these two dates divided by 148 as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{g} = \left(\frac{55,335}{4,803}-1 \right)\frac{1}{148}\times 100 = 7.11\%\]</span>
However, that would be wrong. Starting at $4,803 and assuming GDP per capita grows at an annual growth rate of 7.11% would lead to a level of GDP per capita 148 years later equal to $124,840,484, more than 2000 times the actual value of GDP per capita in 2018! This cannot be a good estimate of the trend growth rate.</p>
<p>The annual growth rate applies to the level of GDP prevailing in the previous year, which grows over time. This formula neglects the fact that the growth rate applies to larger and larger levels of GDP in this example, leading it to overestimate the annual growth rate.</p>
<div id="example-and-intuition" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Example and intuition<a href="LRG.html#example-and-intuition" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <em>compound annual growth rate</em> provides an estimate of the trend growth rate which avoids falling into the same trap while also only requiring as little information to be calculated. Intuitively, it is the growth rate such that if GDP per capita had grown at this same rate every year, then starting at $4,803 in 1870, GDP per capita 148 years later would be exactly equal to $55,335.</p>
<p>Here is how the compound annual growth rate can be derived in the context of our example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume that GDP per capita grows at the same rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> every year.</li>
<li>Using the growth rate formula, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g} = \frac{GDP_{1871}}{GDP_{1870}}-1\)</span>, the value of GDP per capita in 1871 can be written as:
<span class="math display">\[GDP_{1871}=(1+\bar{g})GDP_{1870}\]</span></li>
<li>Similarly, the value of GDP per capita in 1872 is given by:
<span class="math display">\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\bar{g})GDP_{1871}\]</span></li>
<li>Substituting the first expression into the second gives:
<span class="math display">\[GDP_{1872}=(1+\bar{g})(1+\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\bar{g})^{2}GDP_{1870}\]</span></li>
<li>Similarly, GDP per capita in 1873 can be expressed as:
<span class="math display">\[GDP_{1873}=(1+\bar{g})GDP_{1872}=(1+\bar{g})(1+\bar{g})(1+\bar{g})GDP_{1870}=(1+\bar{g})^{3}GDP_{1870}\]</span></li>
<li>By repeated substitution, we obtain the following expression for GDP per capita in 2018 as a function of GDP per capita in 1870 and the constant growth rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[GDP_{2018}=(1+\bar{g})^{148}GDP_{1870}\]</span></li>
<li>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{g}=\left(\frac{GDP_{2018}}{GDP_{1870}} \right)^{\frac{1}{148}}-1 =\left(\frac{55,335}{4,803} \right)^{\frac{1}{148}}-1=0.01665 \]</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g} = 1.67\%\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This result illustrates the <strong>compounding effect</strong> at work in such a growth process where the level of GDP per capita to which the growth rate is applied is updated each year to take into account what happened in the previous year. This effect explains how an economy that is growing at a relatively small annual rate of 1.67% may nevertheless experience the exponential increase observed in Figures <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot1">1.1</a> and <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot3">1.2</a>. The reason why the incorrect method discussed above led to an incorrect estimate of the trend growth rate is because it ignored the presence of these compounding effects.</p>

<span class="math display">\[ \bar{g} = \frac{y_1}{y_0}-1\]</span>
which can be used to derive an expression for <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> on the left hand-side:
<span class="math display">\[y_1 = (1 + \bar{g})y_0\]</span>
Similarly, at time <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[y_2 = (1+\bar{g})y_1\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting for <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[y_2 = (1+\bar{g})(1+\bar{g})y_0=(1+\bar{g})^2y_0\]</span></p>

<span class="math display">\[y_3 = (1+\bar{g})y_2=(1+\bar{g})(1+\bar{g})^2y_0=(1+\bar{g})^3y_0\]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to compute the trend growth rate over any given interval of time by just plugging in values into the compound growth rate formula. But the compound growth rate may be misleading or uninformative as a summary statistic of long-run trends when the growth rate fluctuates widely over time. There may be decades where the growth rate is small (and even negative), followed or preceded by decades where the growth rate is high. It is important to do a preliminary inspection of the data to check that you are fitting the appropriate model to your data.</p>
<p>Add plot of GDP series exhibiting no clear positive trend over time.</p>
<p>More generally, there is no reason to assume that the trend growth rate of GDP should be constant over time. In fact, no one would take seriously the claim that GDP is growing at a constant (deterministic) growth rate over the long-run. However, making this assumption for long enough periods of time can provide some useful approximations to address certain questions. Techniques have been developed to estimate variable trend growth rates. These are more computationally intensive and exploit more information. This is particularly important if we are interested in estimating the short-run deviations of GDP from its trend. For the purpose of evaluating long-run growth trends, we are mainly interested in broad changes in the magnitude of the trend growth rate and it will be useful to complement the analysis by calculating trend growth rates over carefully selected subperiods.</p>

<p>A good approximation to the per-period growth rate can be derived from the properties of logarithms.</p>
<p>The per-period growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> of variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the growth rate in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y_t = (1+g_t) y_{t-1}\)</span>. By taking the natural logarithm on both sides of this expression and subtracting <span class="math inline">\(\ln{y_{t-1}}\)</span>, we obtain:
<span class="math display">\[\ln{y_t} - \ln{y_{t-1}} = \ln{(1+g_t)}\]</span>
from which we derive the following approximation for <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\Delta\ln{y_t}\approx g_t\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\ln{y_t}\)</span> is the change in the natural logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the approximation <span class="math inline">\(\ln{(1+g_t)} \approx g_t\)</span> holds for small values of <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span>. The equality would hold exactly if <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> were a continuous variable (<em>see</em> Appendix). What this result tells us is that the per-period growth rate of variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in any period can be approximated by the change in the natural logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<p>Going back to US real GDP per capita, we already noticed the exponential pattern of GDP per capita over the last two centuries. Focusing on the period 1870-2018, we can now check graphically whether the US economy grew at a relatively constant rate over this period. If the growth rate is constant over time we would expect the plot of its logarithm to be well approximated by a straight line.</p>

This hypothesis can be further evaluated by fitting a line of best fit (in blue) to the plot of the logarithm (right panel) and checking how well the line fits the data. The estimate of the slope of the line of best fit is 0.0167, which corresponds to a growth rate of 1.67% per year and is similar to the compound growth rate calculated in the previous section.</p>

<p>The left and middle panels of Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:logplot2">1.6</a> represent the same variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> growing at a rate of 5% per period and its natural logarithm <span class="math inline">\(\ln{y}\)</span> once again. The natural logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, is the number of times Euler’s number <span class="math inline">\(e=2.72...\)</span> needs to be multiplied by itself in order to obtain <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The plots shows that when <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is equal to 150, its natural logarithm is approximately equal to 5. So 5 is the natural logarithm of 150, or the number of times <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain the number 150 (to be more exact, 5 is the natural logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(e^5=148.4132\)</span>).</p>

<p>This gives us an alternative interpretation of the logarithm plot: every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. So when at time <span class="math inline">\(t=40\)</span> we read off the plot that <span class="math inline">\(lny=2\)</span>, this means that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is approximately equal to <span class="math inline">\(e^2=7.389\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(lny=3\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t=60\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is approximately equal to <span class="math inline">\(e^3=20.086\)</span>. This is the intuition behind the <strong>logarithmic scale</strong> (also called <em>log scale</em> or <em>ratio scale</em>) represented on the right panel, which is constructed by relabeling the value of the natural logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(lny\)</span> on the vertical axis with the corresponding value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Changing the base number of the logarithm allows us to set more intuitive multiplying factors. For example, the logarithm base 2 of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, represents the number of times the number 2 needs to be multiplied by itself to obtain <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. So on a plot of the logarithm base 2 of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (right panel of Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:logplot3">1.7</a>), every tick mark on the vertical axis, y is multiplied by 2. It can be used to read graphically on the horizontal axis how long it takes for variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to double.</p>

<p>We can see that it takes slightly less than fifteen periods for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, which is still growing at the rate of 5% per period, to double. So it would take slightly less than fifteen years for the GDP per capita of an economy that is growing at the rate of 5% per year to double. This may seem surprising but is a direct consequence of the compounding effects discussed before.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: if the variable grows at a constant rate, the slope of the plot of of the logarithm base 2 is constant, but it is not equal to the growth.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Rule of 70<a href="LRG.html#rule-of-70" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Assuming a variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> grows at a constant annual growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, how many years <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> does it take for it to double in value? We just saw how plotting a variable using a log scale allows us to see immediately how long it would take for a variable to double (or triple, quadruple, etc…). It is also possible to address this question numerically using a useful result known as the <em>rule of 70</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rule of 70</em>: if a variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> grows at the rate of <span class="math inline">\(\%g\)</span> per period, then it takes approximately <span class="math inline">\(t \approx \frac{70}{\%g}\)</span> periods for the value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to double.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>Proof</strong></em>: let <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> be such that it is twice the initial income per capita level <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the number of periods it takes for income per capita to double.
Using <span class="math inline">\(y_t = (1+g)^{t} y_0\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[y_t = 2 \times y_0 = (1+g)^ty_0 \quad \rightarrow  2 = (1+g)^t  \]</span>
Taking logs on both sides:
<span class="math display">\[ \ln{2} = t \times \ln{(1+g)}\]</span>
Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\ln{2} \approx 0.7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ln{(1+g)} \approx g\)</span> (for small values of g):
<span class="math display">\[t = \frac{\ln{2}}{\ln{(1+g)}} \approx \frac{0.7}{g} = \frac{70}{\%g}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>So when <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> grows at rate <span class="math inline">\(g=0.05\)</span> in each period as in our example, the formula predicts that it would take approximately <span class="math inline">\(\frac{70}{5}=14\)</span> periods for it to double, in line with what we observed in Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:logplot3">1.7</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot2">1.9</a> shows that on average GDP per capita in the United States grew faster than in the United Kingdom over the last 200 years since it starts at a lower level and ends at a higher level. However, some questions are less easily answered just by looking at this plot. <strong>First</strong>, was the <em>growth rate</em> of GDP per capita in the United States and the United Kingdom constant over time or were there periods of faster (slower) growth? <strong>Second</strong>, was GDP per capita in the United States always growing at a faster rate than in the United Kingdom over these two centuries or only during specific periods?</p>
<p>We can address these questions using the techniques developed in the previous sections. Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot6">1.10</a> plots the logarithm of GDP per capita for both countries and can be used to identify subperiods. Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:mpd2023Tab">1.2</a> presents estimates of the trend growth rates of GDP per capita for both the United States and the United Kingdom for the full sample period and four subperiods.</p>

Figure 1.10: United States vs United Kingdom: GDP per capita (1800-2022)
</p>
</div>
<p><br>
<strong>Did the two economies grow at a constant rate over the last two centuries or were there periods of faster or slower growth?</strong></p>
<p>In the <span style="color: #FA8072;"><strong>United Kingdom</strong></span>, we identify two important points of inflection in the slope of the logarithm plot, in 1830 and 1920, allowing us to distinguish three subperiods. In <span style="color: #FA8072;">1800-1830</span>, the slope of the log plot is relatively flat, suggesting that the trend growth rate was close to zero before 1830. In <span style="color: #FA8072;">1830-1918</span>, the slope of the log plot becomes steeper, suggesting that the trend growth rate established itself clearly in the positive range during this period. In <span style="color: #FA8072;">1920-2022</span>, the slope of the log plot rises again, suggesting that the trend growth rate further rose in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>In the <span style="color: #00CED1;"><strong>United States</strong></span>, the path of GDP per capita exhibits a similar pattern, but with an point of inflection occurring in the 1940s. In <span style="color: #00CED1;">1800-1830</span>, the slope of the log plot is flatter, suggesting that the trend growth rate is positive but moderate before 1830. In <span style="color: #00CED1;">1830-1946</span>, the slope of the log plot becomes steeper, suggesting that the trend growth accelerated during this period. In <span style="color: #00CED1;">1946-2022</span>, the slope of the log plot becomes only slightly steeper, suggesting a relatively constant trend growth rate in the United States over the 20<sup>th</sup> century as previously noted.</p>
<p><strong>Can we identify periods when GDP per capita in the United States grew at a substantially faster rate than that of the United Kingdom?</strong></p>
<p>Over the period <em>1946-2022</em>, the trends in GDP per capita are parallel in the two countries, suggesting that GDP per capita grew at relatively similar rates. However, between <em>1800</em> and <em>1946</em>, GDP per capita grew at a substantially higher trend growth rate in the United States, which is the period when US GDP per capita overtook UK GDP per capita.</p>

<p>The figures in Table <a href="LRG.html#tab:mpd2023Tab">1.2</a> confirm the key points observed above, including the fairly constant trend growth rate of US GDP per capita since the 1830s and the increase in the growth of GDP per capita in both countries in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. This also allows us to make an additional remark. The estimated trend growth rate of GDP per capita in the United States is 0.4 percentage point higher than that of the United Kingdom between 1830 and 1946. This relatively small difference on an annual basis explains why by the end of this period, US GDP per capita was almost 50% higher than that of the UK, having started at a lower level (<em>See</em> Figure <a href="LRG.html#fig:mpdplot2">1.9</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Remark</strong>: we only emphasise here the interpretation of the figures and the broad trends emerging from the data. <em>First</em>, it is difficult to establish what happened to the trend growth rates during the interwar period (from 1919 to 1939). <em>Second</em>, different measures of real GDP may give widely different results for the date at which US GDP per capita overtook UK GDP per capita and also possibly the estimates of trend growth rates. <em>Third</em>, the trend growth rate has clearly declined over the last fifteen years in both countries; however, it may be too early to draw any conclusion regarding the significance of this recent development.</p>

<li>The per-period growth rate is calculated as: <span class="math display">\[\%g_t=\frac{y_t-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} \times 100 \]</span></li>
<li>When a series follows an exponential growth pattern, the compound growth rate provides a useful measure of the trend growth. It is calculated as:
<span class="math display">\[ \bar{g} = \left(\frac{y_t}{y_0}\right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> is the trend growth rate and <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> is the initial value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>The slope of the plot of the logarithm of a variable over time provides a good approximation of the growth rate of this series at any point in time, provided the growth rate is small enough.</li>
<li>Logarithmic scale: A log plot represents how many times a variable is multiplied by a given factor over a certain interval of time. It is particularly well suited to analyse growth trends.</li>

<h2>Appendix: Continuous time notation<a href="LRG.html#appendix-continuous-time-notation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Discrete versus continuous time change</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, we have not made much use of the <em>continuous</em> time notation, preferring to describe the behaviour of variables in <em>discrete</em> time. This reflects the fact that most macroeconomic variables are observed in discrete time.</p>
<p>In the <em>discrete</em> time perspective, variables remain unchanged during the interval between two time periods. In the <em>continuous</em> time perspective, variables remain unchanged for an infinitesimally short amount of time. This leads to different ways of expressing the change in these variables. For a more precise definition of these two concepts see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>continuous time</em> change in variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the <em>instantaneous change</em> in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. It is defined as the change in variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> between two time periods as the interval of time between these two time periods tends to 0. In other terms, it is the derivative of the variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with respect to time, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\dot{y}_t\)</span> and defined as:
<span class="math display">\[\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}=\frac{y_t-y_{t-\Delta t}}{\Delta t}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\dot{y}_t\]</span>
In this course, we will formulate economic models using the discrete time notation. The continuous time notation presents analytical advantages and for this reason is often employed in growth models and in textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous time growth rate</strong></p>
<p>The <em>continuous time</em> counterpart to the growth rate formula described above is the <em>instantaneous growth rate</em> or <em>proportional change</em>. The instantaneous growth rate of variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is calculated as the ratio of the instantaneous change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and its initial value:
<span class="math display">\[g_{t}=\frac{\dot{x}_t}{x_t} \]</span></p>
<p><strong>Compounding growth rate</strong></p>
<p>Assume a variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (GDP, population, …) has initial value <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> and grows at the constant rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.
Continuous compounding corresponds to the case where the frequency of compounding (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times a year) becomes infinitely large. Assuming continuous compounding, after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> periods its value is equal to:
<span class="math display">\[ y_t = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac{g}{n}\right)^{nt} = e^{gt} y_0\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(e = 271828...\)</span> is Euler’s number.</p>
<p>By taking the logarithm of this expression and rearranging, we obtain the following formula for the constant continuous time trend growth rate:
<span class="math display">\[ g = \frac{1}{t}\times(\ln{y_t}-\ln{y_0})\]</span>
<strong>Growth rate and logarithm</strong></p>
<p>Assume a variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has initial value <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> and grows at the continuously compounded constant rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, ie it follows this process: <span class="math inline">\(y_t = e^{gt} y_0\)</span>. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the continuous compounding expression and using the rules of logarithms:
<span class="math display">\[\ln{y_t}=\ln{e^{gt}}+\ln{y_0}=g\times t + \ln{y_0} = C + g \times t\]</span>
Where <span class="math inline">\(C=\ln{y_0}\)</span> (constant).</p>
<p>This expression tells us that the <em>logarithm</em> of variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be expressed as a <em>linear</em> function of time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This implies that if a variable is growing at a constant rate, then the plot of its logarithm against time is a straight line. Moreover, the slope of this plot represents the (continuous time) growth rate of this variable.</p>
