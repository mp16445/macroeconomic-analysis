<p>The aim of this chapter is not to provide a detailed explanation of the life-cycle model, but to summarize the key elements of the model and the key steps that explain the solution of the model. A good understanding of these is required to perform model simulations. The key aim of this chapter is therefore to give you the tools to understand how model simulations work and how they can be used to analyse economic events and confront the predictions of the theory to the data.</p>
<p>You can find a more detailed discussion of the model in the main reference for this part of the course:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> The markets for goods, capital and labour<a href="LCM.html#the-markets-for-goods-capital-and-labour" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Assume an economy where a single <strong>output good</strong> is produced by <strong>firms</strong>. <strong>Households</strong> purchase this good in the <strong>good market</strong> and decide either to consume it or to save it, in which case it becomes instantaneously a capital/investment good. This output good is also the unit of measurement in this economy, so its price is normalised to one (<span class="math inline">\(P=1\)</span>) and all the other prices (wage and interest rate) are expressed in units of output good.</p>
<p><img src="images/LC_MODEL_SETUP.png" width="75%" height="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Firms produce the output good using two factor inputs: capital and labour. The price of renting the capital stock is the interest rate (or rental rate) <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and the price of hiring labour is the wage <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Firms hire labour and capital from households in the market for capital and labour.</p>
<p>We assume that the markets for capital and labour are <strong>perfectly competitive</strong> so that both firms and households take the wage and the interest rate as given when making their labour and capital demand and supply decisions. In other words, individual firms and households do not have the power to affect these prices. Such a situation may arise because there are infinitely many firms and households competing for jobs and workers or because of free market entry.</p>

<div id="production-technology" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Production technology<a href="LCM.html#production-technology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The aggregate production function is assumed to take the form of the <strong>Cobb-Douglas production function</strong>:
<span class="math display">\[ Y_t =A K_t^{\beta}L_t^{1-\beta} \quad [\text{Total output}]\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> is total output, <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> is the total capital stock, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the total amount of labour input (number of workers or hours) <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is total factor productivity (or multifactor productivity) and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the elasticity of output with respect to capital (the elasticity of output with respect to labour is <span class="math inline">\(1-\beta\)</span>).</p>
<p>This production function exhibits two important properties:</p>
<p><strong>Property 1: Constant returns to scale</strong>: Increasing <em>both</em> capital and labour by the same percentage leads to an equal percentage change in output.<br />
<span class="math display">\[ A(\lambda K_t)^\beta(\lambda L_t)^{1-\beta}= \lambda A K_t^{\beta}L_t^{1-\beta}  \]</span></p>
<p><strong>Property 2: Diminishing returns to capital and labour</strong>:
<span class="math display">\[MPK= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial K} = \beta \left(\frac{L_t}{K_t}\right)^{1-\beta} \]</span>
The <strong>marginal product of capital</strong> is the amount by which total output increases when the capital stock increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of labour input. It is decreasing with the size of the capital stock and increasing with the amount of labour input. In other words, the higher the level of the capital stock, the lower its return and the higher the labour input the higher the marginal productivity of capital.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[MPL= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial L} = (1-\beta) \left(\frac{K_t}{L_t}\right)^{\beta} \]</span>
The <strong>marginal product of labour</strong> is the amount by which total output increases when the labour input increases by one marginal unit, holding constant the amount of capital. It is decreasing with the ampunt of labour input used and increasing with the level of the capital stock. In other words, the more labour is used in production, the lower its return and the higher the capital stock, the higher the marginal productivity of labour.</p>
<p>Because our focus will be on <strong>labour productivity</strong>, we will expressed the Cobb-Douglas production function in <em>intensive form</em>:
<span class="math display">\[ y_t =A k_t^{\beta} \quad [\text{Labour productivity}]\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(y = \frac{Y}{L}\)</span> is labour productivity (output per worker/hour) and <span class="math inline">\(k= \frac{K}{L}\)</span> is the capital-labour ratio (the amount of capital per unit of labour used).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Firms’ demand for capital and labour<a href="LCM.html#firms-demand-for-capital-and-labour" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In each periods, firms choose the amount of capital and labour employed that maximises their profits, taking as given <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w}_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}_t\)</span> (perfectly competitive markets).</p>
<p>Firms’ profit maximisation problem:
<span class="math display">\[\max_{L,K} \pi = PY_t - \bar{w}_tL_t-\bar{r}_tK_t\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Py=Y\)</span> is total revenue, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w}L\)</span> is total labour costs and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}K\)</span> is total capital costs,</p>
<p><strong>Firms’ optimal demand for capital and labour satisfy the condition that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(MR = MC\)</span></p>

<img src="images/mpk.png" width="50%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of capital is just equal to the market interest rate. Assuming the interest rate is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}_2\)</span>, the optimal demand for capital is given by <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span>. To see why any other amount of capital stock would not be optimal, let’s consider two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher capital stock would imply a lower marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}_2\)</span>, so firms would be making a loss. Firms would be able to reduce their loss by reducing their capital stock.</li>
<li>A lower capital stock would imply a higher marginal return to capital (due to diminishing returns) than the interest rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}_2\)</span>, so firms would be making a positive profit. Firms would be able to increase their profit by increasing their capital stock by a marginal amount.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firms’ demand for labour</strong>:
<span class="math display">\[MPL= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial L} = (1-\beta)A k_t^{\beta} = \bar{w}_t \]</span>
<img src="images/mpl.png" width="50%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Firms demand capital up to the point where the marginal product of labour is just equal to the market wage. Assuming the wgae is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w}_2\)</span>, the optimal demand for labour is given by <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. Following the same reasoning as for capital, it is possible to show that any other amount of labour would not be optimal.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Setup<a href="LCM.html#setup" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We assume that households live for 2 periods (about 30 years each), so at any point in time they are either “young” or “old”. Households who are young in one period become old in the second period, while a new generation of young households arrives. The diagram below shows how the generations overlap over time.</p>
<p><img src="images/LC_DIAGRAM.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We further assume that there is no population growth, and at any point in time there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> members of the young generation and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> members of the old generation.</p>
<p><strong>“Young” households</strong> start life with zero assets, work full-time and earn labour income <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. At the end of the first period they decide how much of their income to consume, and how much to save. When they save they accumulate the assets that they will hold at the beginning of the net period.</p>
<p><em>More formally, “young” households</em> supply labour, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, earn the market wage <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w}\)</span>, consume <span class="math inline">\(c_{y,t}\)</span> and accumulate assets <span class="math inline">\(a_{t+1}\)</span>. This gives us the <strong>total supply of labour</strong> in the economy:
<span class="math display">\[N  \quad [\text{Labour supply}]\]</span></p>
<p><strong>“Old” households</strong> do not work (they are retired). At the beginning of the period, they invest their assets in their own firms, employ young households to produce output, pay young households wage payments and keep the rest as capital income. At the end of the period they consume all their assets and capital income and end life with zero assets.</p>
<p><em>More formally, “old” households</em>, invest their assets <span class="math inline">\(a_{t+1}\)</span> as capital and earn capital income <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}_{t+1}a_{t+1}\)</span> and consume all their capital and income at the end of the period, <span class="math inline">\(c_{o,t+1}\)</span>. This gives us the <strong>total supply of capital</strong> in the economy as the sum of all the assets accumulated by the old generation at the end of the previous period:
<span class="math display">\[K_{t+1} = Na_{t+1}  \quad [\text{Capital supply}]\]</span></p>

<p>Because there is no uncertainty in the model, households decide on their consumption levels for both periods of their lives at the beginning of their lifetime. More precisely, households’ choices of how much to consume when young and when old maximise their <strong>lifetime utility</strong> subject to their <strong>intertemporal budget constraint</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> The intertemporal budget constraint<a href="LCM.html#the-intertemporal-budget-constraint" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Young households’ budget constraint:
<span class="math display">\[ c_{y,t} + a_{t+1} =  w_t\]</span>
Old households’ budget constraint:
<span class="math display">\[c_{o,t+1}=  (1+r_{t+1})a_{t+1} \quad [\text{Old household consumption}]\]</span>
Combining the two, we obtain the <strong>intertemporal budget constraint</strong>:
<span class="math display">\[ c_{y,t} + \frac{c_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=  w_t \]</span>
which states that the present value of consumption when young and old (left-hand side) should be equal to the present value of lifetime income (right-hand side), where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1+r_{t+1}}\)</span> is the price of consumption when old at the beginning of life.</p>
<p><img src="images/LT_BC.png" width="75%" height="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The intertemporal budget constraint represents the set of combinations of consumption when young and when old that are achievable, for given <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Lifetime utility<a href="LCM.html#lifetime-utility" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Households preferences for consumption over their lifetime takes the form of a Cobb-Douglas utility function:
<span class="math display">\[u_t = c_{y,t}^{\alpha} c_{o,t+1}^{1-\alpha} \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(u_t\)</span> is the lifetime utility of a typical member of the generation born at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1\)</span> is the key preference parameter, assumed to be constant and capturing how much households value consumption when young relative to consumption when old. Lifetime utility is also a measure of the <strong>welfare</strong> of each generation, which depends only on their consumption levels in both periods here.</p>
<p><strong>Important properties of this utility function</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility is increasing in both consumption when young and consumption when old.</li>
<li><strong>Diminishing marginal utility</strong> of consumption: as seen on the diagram, the marginal rate of substitution between <span class="math inline">\(c_{y,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_{o,t+1}\)</span>, ie the rate at which households would be willing to substitute consumption when young for consumption when old is decreasing.</li>

<p>So far we have solved for the saving of “young” households separately. We turn now to the measure of national saving.</p>
<p><strong>Saving of the “young” households</strong> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[ S_{y,t} =  Na_{t+1} \]</span>
<strong>Saving of the “old” households</strong> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[ S_{o,t} =  r_tNa_t - N(1+r_t)a_t = - Na_t \]</span>
where the first term (<span class="math inline">\(r_tNa_t\)</span>) is total capital income earned by all the members of the “old” generation at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the second term (<span class="math inline">\(N(1+r_t)a_t\)</span>) is the total consumption by the members of the “old” generation at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>National saving (<span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>) is equal to the sum of the saving of the young and old households at any given point in time:
<span class="math display">\[S_t = S_{y,t} + S_{o,t} = Na_{t+1} - Na_t  = K_{t+1} - K_t = I_t\]</span>
where investment (<span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>) is equal to the change in the capital stock between the current period and the next (<span class="math inline">\(K_{t+1} - K_t\)</span>) assuming capital does not depreciates.</p>
<p>At any point in time, national investment is equal to national saving. Given that output must be equal to the sum of consumption and investment (<span class="math inline">\(Y_t=C_t+I_t\)</span>), this is equivalent to saying that the good market is in equilibrium.</p>

<p>Having discussed the supply and demand sides of the economy, we are now in a position to solve for the equilibrium values of the key variables of our model, labour productivity, the capital-labour ratio, the wage, the interest and consumption when young and when old.</p>
<div id="equilibrium-in-the-market-for-capital-and-labour" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Equilibrium in the market for capital and labour<a href="LCM.html#equilibrium-in-the-market-for-capital-and-labour" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Equilibrium in the labour and capital markets is achieved when demand is equal to supply.</p>
<p><img src="images/KLE.png" width="75%" height="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The demand for labour is decreasing in the wage whereas the supply of labour is fixed (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) and independent of the wage. Therefore, <strong>equilibrium labour input</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span>) is equal to the fixed labour supply:
<span class="math display">\[L_t = N  \quad [\text{Equilibrium labour}]\]</span>
and the <strong>equilibrium wage</strong> is equal to the marginal product of labour at this equilibrium value of labour:
<span class="math display">\[MPL= (1-\beta)A k_t^{\beta} = w_t \quad [\text{Equilibrium wage}]\]</span>
Equilibrium wage is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> and TFP <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The higher the capital-labour ratio or TFP, the more productive is an additional unit of labour input and the higher the wage.</p>
<p>The demand for capital is decreasing in the interest rate whereas the current supply of capital per worker is independent of the interest rate and is determined by the savings of the “old” generation in the previous period, which in turns is determined by the wage received by the old generation in the previous period:
<span class="math display">\[K_t = Na_t = N(1-\alpha)w_{t-1} \quad [\text{Equilibrium capital stock}]\]</span>
Therefore, the <strong>equilibrium capital input</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span>) is equal to its supply of capital at the beginning of the current period, and similarly for the <strong>equilibrium capital-labour ratio</strong>:
<span class="math display">\[k_t = (1-\alpha)w_{t-1} \quad [\text{Equilibrium capital-labour ratio}]\]</span>
The <strong>equilibrium interest rate</strong> is determined by the current level of the capital-labour ratio <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> and TFP <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> The transition equation<a href="LCM.html#the-transition-equation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Derivation</strong></p>
<p>Because output and labour productivity depend on the capital stock (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>), labour (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) and total factor productivity (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) and the last two are fixed parameters, only changes in the capital stock can explain changes in growth in this model economy.</p>
<p>The <strong>transition equation</strong> is the key equilibrium condition of this model. The intuition for this equation is provided by the discussion in the previous section. What determines the capital stock in each period?</p>
<p>The capital-labour ratio at time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1}\)</span>) is determined by the assets accumulated by households of the “old” generation in the previous period (<span class="math inline">\(a_{t+1}\)</span>), which was determined by the wage they earned in the previous period (<span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span>), which in turn was determined by the previous period capital-labour ratio (<span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span>).</p>
<p>The transition equation makes this link between current and future capital-labour ratio appear more clearly:<br />
<span class="math display">\[k_{t+1} = a_{t+1} =(1-\alpha)w_t = (1-\alpha)(1-\beta)A k_t^{\beta} \]</span>
The equilibrium value of the capital-labour ratio at any point in time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> depends on the fixed parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and on its value at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. In order to solve for the equilibrium values of <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> at each point in time, <span class="math inline">\(t=0, 1, 2, 3, ...\)</span>, we also need to know its initial value <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The transition path diagram</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/TPD1.png" width="55%" height="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The transition path diagram represents the equilibrium values of <span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1}\)</span> for all the possible values that can be taken by <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span>. The straight line is a 45-degree line whereby <span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1}=k_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>To understand the dynamics of the equilibrium capital ratio, we can trace its time path starting with any initial value <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span>. The diagram represents one such time path. Starting from the initial value <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span>, the capital stock increases at <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span> as the transition equation is above the 45-degree line. In the next period, starting with an initial value <span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span>, the capital stock keeps increasing as the transition equation is still above the 45-degree line. This continues until the capital ratio reaches the value <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span>, at which point it remains constant.</p>
<p>It is possible to show that starting at an initial value <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span> above <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span> would lead it to converge down towards <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span> over time. <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span> is the steady state value of the capital stock. It represents the equilibrium value of the capital ratio in the long-run.</p>
<p>Why is the capital-labour ratio converging to a constant value? Assume for now that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.5\)</span>, so that young households save half of their first period labour income (<span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t\)</span>). For the capital stock to increase, young households’ savings must be higher than the current capital stock (<span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t&gt;k_t\)</span>). As the capital stock increases, the wage increases but by less and less with each additional increase in the capital stock (due to diminishing returns) and therefore so does the increase in the savings of the young. As the additional savings generated by an additional unit of capital falls over time, it will arrive a point where the savings of the young are just equal to the current capital stock (<span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1} = a_{t+1}= 0.5w_t=k_t\)</span>). At this point, the saving of the young in each period is just enough to maintain the capital stock at the same level in each period. The capital stock will stabilise at this level and the economy will stop growing.</p>

<p>Once we have the equilibrium value of the capital ratio, it is possible to solve for the values of all the other <strong>endogenous variables</strong> of the model using the following relationships:
<span class="math display">\[y_t = Ak_t^\beta\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[K_t = k_tN \quad \text{and} \quad Y_t = y_tN\]</span>

<p>The steady state is defined as the long-run position towards which the economy converges, or the long run equilibrium. In this model, it corresponds to a situation in which the capital-labour ratio remains constant.</p>
<p>Using the transition equation and this definition, it is possible to solve for the steady state value of the capital ratio <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span>:

Because all the other variables of the model are determined by the capital-labour ratio, they also all converge to a constant steady state value. In other words, this model cannot explain growth in the long-run.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Analysis of shocks<a href="LCM.html#analysis-of-shocks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>exogenous parameters</strong> of the model (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span>) capture charateristics of the economic environment which may change as a result of shocks occurring outside of the model. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> captures the propensity to consume when young relative to when old and affects directly the share of labour income saved by young households, and therefore capital accumulation. This parameter may change due to cultural changes in the attitude of yonger generations towards the future, policies changing the incentives to save (eg taxation of savings), …</p>
<p>An interesting exercise therefore is to analyse the effect of a shock to these parameters on growth (of capital, output, labour productivity, consumption) both on the short-run and long-run equilibrium values (ie the steady state) of the economy.</p>
<p>For example, we can ask what would be the effect of a permanent rise in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, ie an increase in young households’ propensity to consume, and therefore a fall in their saving on labour productivity growth in the long-run and the short-run. The diagram below shows how the transition path schedule would shift down on impact as for a given level of the capital ratio and income per worker the level of saving falls, leading to an immediate fall in the capital stock on the next period. The economy would then converge to a lower steady state value of the capital-labour ratio.</p>
<p><img src="images/saving_shock.png" width="55%" height="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The model therefore predicts that a rise in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> would lead to a fall in the labour productivity <strong>growth</strong> rate in the short-run, but not in the long-run as the capital ratio stabilises at a new steady state level eventually. However, the shock would have a permanent negative effect on the <strong>level</strong> of the capital-labour ratio and therefore on the level of productivity growth since <span class="math inline">\(y_t\downarrow = A(k_t\downarrow)^\beta\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> The life-cycle model with population growth<a href="LCM.html#the-life-cycle-model-with-population-growth" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>So far we have assumed no population growth. To capture the fact that the population may be growing over time and analyse the effects of changes in the population growth rate on the equilibrium values of the variables in the model, we now assume that population is growing as follows:
<span class="math display">\[ N_{y,t+1} = (1+n)N_{y,t}= (1+n)N_{o,t+1} \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(N_{y,t+1}\)</span> is the number of households in the young generation at time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_{y,t}\)</span> is the number of households in the young generation at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, which is the same as the number of households in the old generation at time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_{o,t+1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the constant exogenous growth rate of the population.</p>
<p>Since the capital-labour ratio <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> represents the amount of capital per worker, it is now defined as the amount of capital per member of the young generation:
<span class="math display">\[k_t=\frac{K_t}{N_{y,t}}\]</span></p>
<p>and since labour productivity <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> represents the amount produced per worker it is now defined as the amount of output produced per member of the young generation:
<span class="math display">\[y_t=\frac{Y_t}{N_{y,t}}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Transition equation </strong></p>
<p>The equilibrium in the capital market states that the capital stock in the next period is equal to the assets accumulated by the current old generation in the previous period:
<span class="math display">\[K_{t+1}= N_{o,t+1}a_{t+1}  \]</span>
Since everything else remains the same, assets at time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> are still equal to <span class="math inline">\(a_{t+1}=(1-\alpha) w_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_t= (1-\beta) Ak_t^{\beta}\)</span>, we can derive the transition equation as follows:
<span class="math display">\[ k_{t+1} = \frac{K_{t+1}}{N_{y,t+1}} =\frac{N_{o,t+1}a_{t+1}}{N_{y,t+1}}= \frac{a_{t+1}}{1+n} = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n}w_{t} = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n}(1-\beta) Ak_t^{\beta}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Transition path diagram </strong></p>
<p>The transition path diagram below conserves the same concave due to diminishing returns to capital. Along the equilibrium path, the economy will therefore still converge to a steady state where the capital-labour ratio is constant.</p>
<p><img src="images/TPD3.png" width="55%" height="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Along the equilibrium path, the economy will therefore still converge to a steady state where the capital-labour ratio is constant. However now, the steady state capital-labour ratio is lower as the assets accumulated by the old generation in the previous period is now spread out over a higher number of households of the young generation in the current period. This means that more savings in the previous period will be required to maintain the same level of the capital-labour ratio.</p>
<p>One can now ask what happens to the growth rate of the capital-labour ratio in the short-run when the population growth rate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> changes.</p>
<p><img src="images/TPD4.png" width="55%" height="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>A rise in the population growth rate rotates the transition curve down. Since the initial steady state level of capital was just sufficient to generate savings required to maintain it at the same level, it is not enough to accommodate larger arrivals of young workers in the labour market. As a result, the capital-labour ratio falls in the short-run, before stabilising at a new lower steady state level in the long-run.</p>
<p><strong>The steady state in the model with population growth</strong></p>
<p>In the model with population growth, the equilibrium values of the variables of the model converge to different steady state growth rates.</p>
<p>First, labour productivity <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the wage <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, the interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and all the other per worker variables such as consumption <span class="math inline">\(c_y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_o\)</span> and savings <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> are functions of the capital-labour ratio <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Since the steady state value of the capital-labour ratio is constant, they also converge to a constant steady state value. In other words, as in the model without population growth, this model still cannot explain long-run growth in labour productivity and living standards.</p>
<p>Second, output <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the capital stock <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and consumption grow at the constant population growth rate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Using the definition of the capital-labour ratio, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}=\frac{K_t}{N_{y,t}}\)</span> in the steady state. Since <span class="math inline">\(\bar{k}\)</span> is constant and <span class="math inline">\(N_{y,t}\)</span> grows at the rate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it must be that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{K}_t\)</span> is also growing at the rate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in the steady state. The same reasoning follows output. This model predicts that in an economy with no labour productivity growth, output would be growing at a constant rate in the long-run, equal to the population growth rate.</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> is the current debt (the stock of government bonds), <span class="math inline">\(G_t\)</span> is government spending (consumption), <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span> is net tax payments (the difference between the amount received by the government in tax revenues and transfers to households) and <span class="math inline">\(R_{t+s} = 1+r_{t+s}\)</span> is the period <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> <em>discount factor</em>.</p>
<p>The GIBC states that the sum of the current debt and the present value of future government spending (consumption) must be equal to the present value of future net tax payments.

<p>In this section, we assume no population growth, so there are the same number of households in each generation (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>).</p>
<p>Assume the government wants to finance government spending <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and all following periods. Furthermore, this additional government consumtpion is fully consume during the period, ie it has no impact on the economy’s capital stock or productivity in the subsequent periods.</p>
<p>Because the GIBC must hold at all times, such an expenditure can be financed at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> either by taxation or by running a budget deficit (borrowing) which must be repaid by higher taxes in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Taxation (only)</strong></p>
<p>Assume current government purchases are financed in full by higher taxation in the current period.</p>
<p>Net tax payments can either fall on young households or on old households as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Z_t = Nz_{y,t} + Nz_{o,t} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t}\)</span> is net tax payments by young households and <span class="math inline">\(z_{o,t}\)</span> is net tax payments by old households.</p>
<p>We will only consider the two extreme cases where all the tax burden falls on the young or on the old households:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The burden of taxation falls entirely on old households</em>:
<span class="math display">\[Z_t=Nz_{o,t}=N\bar{g}=\bar{G}\]</span>
Each household of the old generation pays an equal share <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>. The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{z}= \frac{z_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\frac{\bar{g}}{1+r_{t+1}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The burden of taxation falls entirely on young households</em>:
<span class="math display">\[Z_t=Nz_{y,t}=N\bar{g}=\bar{G}\]</span>
Each household of the old generation pays an equal share <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>. The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to:
<span class="math display">\[\hat{z}= z_{y,t}=\bar{g}\]</span>
The tax burden is higher under the second scheme because households forego the interest rate they would have earned on their first period income by paying taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deficit finance</strong></p>
<p>Assume current government purchases are financed in full by a budget deficit (higher borrowing) in the current period, which is fully repaid by higher taxation in the next period.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G_t = B_{t+1} = Nb_{t+1}\]</span></p>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: the government sells bonds <span class="math inline">\(b_{t+1}\)</span> to “young” households. Young households purchase bonds at the beginning of period <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> with the savings they would have used to purchase capital assets.</p>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>: the government repays the amount borrowed from old households with interest <span class="math inline">\((1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}\)</span> and simultaneously taxes them to raise the funds <span class="math inline">\(z_{o,t+1} = (1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}\)</span> needed to pay these interest repayments. <em>Deficit finance</em> is deferred taxation.</p>
<p>This gives the third method to finance government spending <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Deficit finance (borrowing)</em>:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{G} = B_{t+1} = Nb_{t+1}=N\bar{g}\]</span>
Each household of the old generation purchase an equal share <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> of the debt at the beginning of period <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> with their previous period saving, are repaid with interest at the end of the period and pay the same amount in tax. The present value of taxation for households under such a scheme is equal to:
<span class="math display">\[\hat{z}= \frac{z_{o,t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\frac{(1+r_{t+1})b_{t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}}=\bar{g}\]</span>
Households’ tax burden over their lifetime in this third scheme is the same as under the second scheme. If households can fully anticipate that budget deficits today leads to higher taxation in the future, they should realise that financing higher government spending with higher debt is equivalent to being taxed more when young.</li>

<p>Fiscal policy only changes the consumption-saving decision of households, so we focus on the equilibrium conditions associated with households’ decisions.</p>
<p>To simplify the exposition further, we will assume that households do not care about consumption when young (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span>). Although not a realistic assumption, this is not a crucial assumption to analyse the role of taxation on capital accumulation.</p>
<p><em>Young household consumption</em>:
<span class="math display">\[c_{y,t} = \alpha w_t = 0\]</span>
<em>Capital assets accumulated by young households (= Saving - bonds purchased)</em>:

<p>The transition diagram conserves the same concave shape as in the model without fiscal policy due to diminishing returns to capital. However an increase in taxes on young households (the savers) or in the budget deficit rotates the transition path diagram clockwise. The steady state capital-labour ratio is now lower. In the absence of fiscal policy (<span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t}=z_{o,t}=b_{t+1}=0\)</span>), savings would be fully invested in capital assets and contribute to the capital stock in the next period.</p>
<p>With fiscal policy (<span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t}+b_{t+1}&gt;0\)</span>), savings are reduced by the amount that needs to be paid in tax (<span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t}\)</span>) and are used in part to purchase government debt <span class="math inline">\(b_{t+1}\)</span>. A the initial steady state level of the capital-labour ratio, the same wage leads to lower investment in capital assets and therefore a lower capital stock in the next period. This means that a higher wage in the previous period would be required to maintain the same level of the capital-labour ratio, which has become unsustainable. As a result, the economy converges to a lower steady state level of the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity.</p>
<p>A fiscal policy shock affects capital accumulation and growth when the sum of taxation of the young and the debt (<span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t}+b_{t+1}\)</span>) changes. A rise in either of these policies, holding everything else constant will lead the capital-labour ratio and labour productivity (and their growth) to fall for some time before stabilising permanently at a lower level.</p>

<div id="government-investment" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.8.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.5</span> Government investment<a href="LCM.html#government-investment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>So far we have assumed that government spending is fully consumed within the period. However, the government does invest in infrastructure projects, buildings, research, …, which adds to the capital stock.</p>
<p><strong>Transition equation</strong></p>
<p>To capture this fact, the capital stock at time <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> can be rewritten as:
<span class="math display">\[K_{t+1} = Na_{t+1} + K_{t+1}^G\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Na_{t+1}\)</span> is the privately-owned capital stock and <span class="math inline">\(K_{t+1}^G\)</span> is government capital assets.</p>
<p>Expressed per unit of labour, this gives the following revised transition equation:
<span class="math display">\[ k_{t+1} =  a_{t+1} + k_{t+1}^G = w_t - (z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}) + k_{t+1}^G =(1-\beta) A k_t^{\beta} - (z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}) + k_{t+1}^G\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(k_{t+1}^G\)</span> represents an additional channel through which government policy affects capital accumulation and growth.</p>
<p><strong>Transition path diagram</strong></p>
<p>To see the effect of government capital investment on growth and living standards in the long-run, we now turn to the transition diagram.</p>
<p><img src="images/TPD6.png" width="65%" height="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>For given initial levels of the capital labour ratio, taxation and debt, a rise in government investment (relative to pure government consumption or transfer) raises the capital labour ratio in the next period. This leads to a rise in labour productivity, the wage and savings, which raises further the capital stock.In the short-run, a rise in government spending on capital assets therefore raises growth. In the long-run, the economy converges to a new higher steady state level of the capital stock.</p>
<p>Ultimately, government investment needs to be financed, leading to two possible cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(k^G_{t+1}\)</span> is financed by taxing the young or by borrowing (<span class="math inline">\(z_{y,t} +b_{t+1}\uparrow\)</span>) then the net effect on capital accumulation is null: government investment replaces private investment.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(k^G_{t+1}\)</span> is financed by taxing the old then the net effect on capital accumulation is positive.</li>

<li>Is there something inaccurate in the reasoning or that you do not understand? If yes, can you write a follow-up prompt to address it?</li>
<li>Which element of the prompt improves the quality of the answer?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prompt 1: Explaining and comparing the concepts </strong></p>
<p><em>“Provide a clear, multiple paragraph explanation addressed to a second-year university student of the two concepts of equilibrium and the steady state in macroeconomic models such as the life-cycle growth model. First, explain each concept separately. Then explain the key differences between them.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Prompt 2: Exploring the relevance of a concept beyond Economics</strong></p>
<p><em>“Provide the name of three disciplines beyond Economics where the two concepts of equilibrium and steady state are commonly used. For each discipline, can you provide one example of a problem to which these concepts are applied. Explain these examples as if I know nothing of the discipline.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Prompt 3: Create a quiz to test your understanding or the understanding of your peers</strong></p>
<p><em>“Create a diagnostic quiz on equilibrium and steady state concepts in the life-cycle growth model for a second-year university student. Look up the topic and construct five highly relevant multiple-choice questions that go beyond just definitions. Multiple choice questions should include plausible, competitive alternate responses and should not include an”all of the above option.” At the end of the quiz, you will provide an answer key and explain the right answer.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt the test</li>
<li>Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the question.</li>
<li>Select the best three MCQs and propose them to one of your peers.</li>
<li>Once you are confident you can answer all questions, ask for more difficult questions in a follow-up prompt (eg by adopting the persona of an researcher in academia).</li>

<p>This exercise guides you through the calculation of the equilibrium and steady state values of a model economy. It then asks you to perform some simple analyses of shocks to the model and produce model predictions that are easily comparable to real world observations (log plots and growth accounting results).</p>
<p><em>In order to perform these practice questions, you will need to work on a laptop or a desktop computer (using a mouse), <strong>not</strong> a tablet. You also need to have installed Excel on your device (you may not be able to perform all the operations using the web version).</em></p>
